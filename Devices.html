A punch card is a piece of rigid paper containing digital information which is represented by the absence of holes predefined positions. These 17-centimetre (also called Hollerith cards) are used in semiautomatic data processing. The machine was completed in 1880 by Herman Hollerith, having 40 counters where each of them had a dial diveded into 100 divisions, and was processed by an electrical circuit. The population was growing rapidly, so the machine was needed for reading different kinds of data (like gender and age). The U.S.Constitution required a census every decade, so they counted the Americans population and got a number of 4 million people, but a century later the problem was huge. The population had grown rapidly and now the population was pretty much uncountable, and estimates warned that the 1890 census wouldn't be finished before 1900 census began, but then came Herman Hollerith who had the idea to record data on punched cards which would be read by a tabulating machine. Due to the machine essentials, it was a massive success and was used up to the 1950s.

                    This motor-driven mechanical computer was designed by the computer scientist Kondrad Zuse in his
                    parent's home from 1936 to 1938. The computer red instructions from pierced celluloid film, it was
                    electrically driven mechanical calculator that had limited programmability. Z1 used <a class="link"

                    <a class="link" target="_blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">floating-point numbers</a> where
                    it was unreliable in action. Originally it was named "V1" for Versuchsmodell 1 which means
                    Experimental Model 1, but after World War II it was renamed "Z1" to make a difference from the
                    flying bombs designed by Robert Lusser. This machine overall consisted the control unit, micro
                    sequences, memory, floating-point logic and input-output devices. The tape reader made this computer
                    freely programmable, where it red perforations in 35-millimeter film. Kondrad have made models like
                    Z2 and Z3 which were based on this model, they were also destroyed in WW2, but he still got his
                    credits for creating the first programmable computer. For summary this 1 ton weighting, including
                    20,000 parts, remains as the first computer ever made.

                    It was the first programmable, digital computer that was invented in 1943, by physicist John Mauchly
                    and John Presper Eckert. This concept cost them $487,000 and the building took about 18 months where
                    they decided to activate this heavy-weighted machine after the war was over, but no, the U.S
                    military didn't care and put ENIAC to work. It showed weather predictions, commiting calculations
                    for the hydrogen bomb design, random-number studies, cosmic-ray researches and wind-tunnel design.
                    In 1946, Eckert and Mauchly developed the Electrical Numerical Integrator and Calculator which was
                    called the "ENIAC". This was the machine that was essential to the American military, so they could
                    use calculations for artillery-firing tables and other settings for target accuracy. These 270cm
                    tall (9 foot) cabinet-like computers were fitted into a room that contained 40 of them. Inside the
                    ENIAC were 17,468 vacuum tubes with 70,000 resistors, 1,500 relays, 6,000 manual switches, 10,000
                    capacitors and 5 million soldered joints. This comptuer's dimensions covering 167 square meters
                    along with 30 tons of weight was literally a parked tank in a room. It took 160 kilowatts of
                    electrical power, and to prevent overheating, was to develope two 20 horsepower blowers to deliver
                    some cool air. At the time ENIAC was 1,000 times faster than any other calculators. This machine has
                    got several improvements over the years, initially it could hold a 10-digit decimal number in
                    memory, and later in 1956 they built 20 more of these calculators. Overall it was the first computer
                    used, and was often called the "Giant Brain".

Transistor is a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device">semiconductor</a> device that contains at least 3 terminals to connect an electric circuit. Commonly the third terminal controls the flow of current which is between the other 2 terminals. Its used in radio recievers or for quick switching. Replacing the vacuum-tube, much larger and more power consuming <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triode">thermionic</a> valve, so this thing needed to reach it's goal. On December 1947 it was itroduced as the first transistor at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Laboratories</a> which was in Murray Hill, New Jersey. The main idea of a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor">field-effect transistor</a> was designed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. After many attemtmps, failing with many different tools, the fully working one was invented by whole 3 research scientists, including John Bardeen, Willaim Shockley and Walter Brattain. They glued a small piece of gold foil to the edge of a triangular plastic wedge, a bit later one of them sliced the foil with a razor at the tip of the triangle, where the result was 2 very closely spaced contacts of gold. The plastic was put down to a crystal surface where the voltage said "yes" to the other side, ok I'm kidding but it applied which was now on the base of the crystal. As the base voltage pushed the electrons away from the base towards the other side located near the contacts when current started to flow from one contact to the other, and Immediately the point-contact transistor was invented.

                    JOHNNIAC was one of the early computers built by the <a class="link" target="_blank"

                    straightly operating for 13 years before finally shutting this machine down on February 11, 1966.
                    Using 40-bit words and containing 1024 words of Selectron tube primary memory where each of them
                    held 256 bits of data. Several improvements have been made to this computer over the years, where
                    4096 words of <a class="link" target="_blank"

                    the system which replaced the earlier Selectrons in March 1955. In 1955 this required 12 bits of
                    addressing and had caused programs that stored data spare bits to fail, so a 12,000-word <a

Why it was needed? - Simple answer, building computers. Computer technology was already hard to understand since the 1940s, and now came the integrated circuit. Also known as a microship which is a set of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit">electronic circuits</a> on a small flat piece that is commonly made out of silicon, but sometimes <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> material. The chip includes mainly a large number of tiny transistors along with other small electronic parts. Chips are pretty much everywhere now, in memory, computer processors, 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Robert Noyce was the inventor of the monolithic integrated circuit which was finished in 1959. It was also made out of silicon. In the modern world IC chips are based on Noyce's monolithic IC, but the actual idea of a ingtegrated circle was made by Jack Kilby, so Robert Noyce doesn't remain as the first inventor, because he was the one who made it more buyable. Jack Kilby demonstrated the integrated circle on September 12, 1958, that had external gold-wire connections, so it made almost impossible to mass-produce, but he still remains the first creoter of a integrated circle and won the 2000 Nobel Prize in physics, invention of the integrated circuit. For summary Jack Kilby was the inventor, and Robert Noyce was who made it to mass-production.

Its an English computer programming language that was built for business use, by <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODASYL">CODASYL</a> in 1959. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC">FLOW-MATIC</a> programming language designed by Grace Hopper - where the COBOL was based. Created as a piece of US Department of Defense effort, where it made a portable programming language for data processing. The statements have an English-like syntax where it was designed to be highly readable. COBOL overall had English syntax, for example "MOVE y to x", while the modern-day statements are easier "y = x;". The language wasn't also liked by many because of the verbosity, bad support for structed programming and design process, but its still being used for businesses actions in mainframes. The designers of the language were Jean E. Sammet, Norman Discount, Howard Bromberg, William Selden and Gertrude Tierney.

Often called Sabre Global Distribution System, is used by companies to price, book, search and ticket travel services which are provided by airlines, even car rentals and hotels, some times it was also used by <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_agency">travel agents</a>. Developed by the CEO C.R. Smith who was from the American Airlines, in the game was the assistance of IBM in 1960. Later in 1976, the booking service became available for external travel agents. Originally its called "Semi-automated Business Research Environment" where it was spelled "SABRE". The American Airlines needed automatic booking reservations, so the magic needed to happen. Large growth in passenger volumes in the airline industry was a serious problem to American Airlines In the 1950s, because the booking system was entirely manual. About 8 operators needed to sort through a rotating file with cards per flight. When a seat was booked then the team would place a mark on the side of the card where they knew whether it was full or not. Usually writing up a ticket took 1.5 - 3 hours. In 1952 they introduced the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservisor#Magnetronic_Reservisor">Magnetronic Reservisor</a> to replace the card files. This electromechanical computer consisting a single magnetic drum and every memory location was holding the number of seats left on specific flight, but at least 1 staff member was needed at each end of the line, where the ticket was difficult to handle. In 1953 Blair Smith was on an American Airlines flight where he found himself sitting next to American Lines president C.R. Smith. IBM along with the United States Air Force had been working on their Semi Automatic Ground Environment project (SAGE). SAGE originally used a large amount of computers to coordinate the message flow from radar sites to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_aircraft">interceptors</a>, so if an attack of a bomber was gonna come, they could fastly direct the bomber. The system what they used were the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> machines that collect around the world information into the system. Also known as one of the first online systems, SABRE tought to use it for their booking system, and it was a success in 1960. Based on 2 IBM 7090 mainframes, the system was installed and cost $40 million at the time. Now their system could handle a huge number of transactions, like 83,000 phone calls per day.

The machine is also known as P101 or Perottina which was one of the first commercial desktop programmable calculators that succedeed easily. It was invented by Pier Giorgio Perotto, where it was introduced at the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair">1964 New York World's Fair</a> and later the manufacturer Olivetti began to produce these machines in 1965. In that time the machine looked pretty futuristic and was priced at $3,200. Over 44,000 units were sold, mainly in the United States. Overall the Programma 101 was a typewriter-sized machine that had 37 keys, including a printer, weighted about 29 kg, and had a total of 240 bytes of information where it was stored in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-line_memory#Magnetostrictive_delay_lines">magnetostrictive delay-line memory</a>, had a cycle time of 2.2 milliseconds.

The floppy disk, also known as memory disk was introduced in 1971 by Alan Shugart. Initially people used punched cards for software programming and data entry, but in 1967, a small team of engineers led by David L.Noble started developing an inexpensive and reliable system for installing software updates into mainframe computers, and loading instructions. It got it's nickname "floppy" because the disk got some flexibility. The 20-cm magnetic material circle covered with magnetic iron oxide, could hold 80 KB of data at the time. This time a 3,000 punched cards were equal to 1 disk where it could easily store data on it. In 1973 the 8-inch IBM Diskette was another disk made by IBM, that could already hold 250 KB of data. There on, the disks were gaining a lot more data and yet more advanced because the compnay started to know the basics of a disk. In 1978, IBM wanted to reach $135 million for media and $875 million for drives, one disk cost $5 to 8.

Before the mass-market GUI machines became available, the Xerox Alto was already introduced a decade earlier on March 1, 1973 by <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>. This whole machine contained a small cabinet that used central processing unit which known as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>, its built from a large amount of SSI and MSI integrated circuits. Later in the late 1970s, over 500 of these were put into several universities and another 1000 of these computers where put into Xerox laboratories. It was the first machine that actually looked like computer, single screen, a 3-button mouse and a keyboard. Having 128KB of memory cost $4000 at the time, 5.8 MHz CPU, 64-key board with a 5-finger key set, display was 606 x 808 pixels and 2.5 MB removable cassete hard drive. About 2,000 of these systems were ever made.

The Apple Computer Company was found by 3 businessmen, including Steve Jobs, Ronald Wayne and Steve Wozniak on April 1, 1976, to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The computer was established as Apple Computer, Inc by Jobs and Wozniak in 1977. Later came one of the mass-produced <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer">microcomputers</a> which was the Apple II, and became a best seller. Pretty much the compnay was founded because they were selling some good computers under the Apple's name. It went public in 1980 where it became instantly successful, and overall the company has done several large achivements. For example they built the Macintosh 128K and became famous due to it's inexpensive use of graphical user interface and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> printing. Now the company is worth over $3 trillion and is ranked among the most valuable brands of all time.

This computer is also known as the Apple's Machintosh. It was first introduced by a television commercial on January, 1984, it was entitled "1984". The set included a small 23-cm (9-inch) screen with a keyboard and one single-button mouse, which was sold for US$2,495. Immediately after its realease, over 50,000 units were sold on April 1984, and by the end of the year were sold 250,000 of these computers. The computer's heart was a Motorola 68000 <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor">microprocessor</a> that runned at 7.8 MHz, and was connected to 128 KB RAM which was shared by the processor along with the display controller. Computers in the 20th century have been these massive-scaled machines to do some serious work, but the Macintosh 128K was a light-weight family computer that was used for businesses, calculating and overall it was used for daily work. Weighted 7.5 kilograms, included removable 3½ inch floppy disk, operation was the System Software 1.0, and the monochrome-toned screen had 512 x 342 pixels. The production ended on October 1, 1985.

Developed by Microsoft, it was released on July 14, 1995 and got to selling on August 24, 1995. Before it was released, users in United Kingdom and States had a change to participate in the Windows 95 Preview Program. The participants got a free preview of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Dial-up">Microsoft Network</a> online service that launched Windows 95. You could do an upgrade from Windows 3.1x or a fresh installation if you paid US$19.95 for several 8.8-cm floppy disks that can install the Windows 95. To give a better performing system, Windows 95 needed mulitple 16-bit Windows programs and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver">device drivers</a>, it was along with <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> system. It also included 255-character mixed-case long filenames, 32-bit applications with multitask protected-mode, and the Device Manager to configure what devices were working with correct drivers, including a optimization to allow the user to replace automatic Plug and Play-based driver installation with manually-working options. There were also given a pile of semi-automatic configuration choices to give it a try and free up some resources for devices that still needed manual set up. In 1998, Windows 95 was used by 57.4% of desktop users. Overall Windows 95 was a successful system due to new set of items, including an accessible internet, gaming platform, long file names and also the Start button and taskbar.

    The most used web-based search engine was launched in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the students from Stanford University in California. They built a search algorithm with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg, which was first known as "BackRub" in 1996. It was decided to make it use for public in 2004 and quickly became one of the largest media companies. The domain <i>google.com</i> was registered on September 15, 1997, and in 1998 in Susan Wojcicki's garage, Google was established. In 1999 they had the plan to sell Google to George Bell, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="">Excite</a> CEO. Brin and Page asked $1 million, but Bell rejected the offer, so <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a> talked the due down to $750,000, and later Bell still rejected the offer. In March 1999, the company moved into new office called "165 University Avenue" which was in Palo Alto. Google has stood there ever since and now has corporate headquarters called Googleplex, which the company bought from SGI for US$319 million. It became successful because it let people sort through a huge amount of content to deliver some really accurate results or answers. According to modern days, Google has 3.5 billion searches per day.

It is one of the Macintosh computers that Apple sold from 1998 to 2003. This computer has been reqognizable due to its blue transparent plastic case. This all-in-one designed was based around a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">cathode ray tube</a> display, so you could see little squares on your screen. It wasn't the S-tier computer tho, because according to some people the keyboard and mouse turned out be uncomfortable. The keyboard's keys were set in completely different places this time, and they preferred more like a oval-shaped mouse more than a complete circle under their hand, which was called the hockey puck mouse. This computer was available in 13 color versions - blueberry, lime, Tangarine, Strawberry, Grape, Graphite, Ruby, Sage, Indigo, Snow, Flower Power, Blue Dalmatian and the Bondi which was the main color, most popular one. The PC power was 233 MHz, 512k cache/32MB, a 4GB Hard Drive, a 24X CD drive which was tray loading, and included USB ports. The computer's avarage life span was close to 5 years, and the price tag was US$1,299. At the first month the company sold 800,000 of these 17 kg weighted machines. Overall 5 million of these were sold over the years of mass-production, saving Apple from extinction.

In 2000, they sold the first, also known as memory stick, which was called ThumbDrive. One of the inventors was Pua Khein-Seng who is mostly known for inventing the device. The memory stick which was encased in plastic, was connected to a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">Universal Serial Bus</a>. It was drawing power from a computer when connected, with it's 8 megabytes of data, and was also pretty delicant like a compact disk, it couldn't be scratched. By the end of July 2000, a bigger number than 100,000 of ThumbDrives were sold, replacing the small storage capacity floppy disks that could store about 1.44 MB of data, compared to the ThumbDrive that could hold 8 MB.

    This social networking service was originally launched as FaceMash on October 28, 2003, and later on February 4, 2004, the name was changed to TheFaceBook. Mark Zuckerberg who studied at Harvard University, was the founder of Facebook. Initially in September 2006, to create a facebook account, you needed to be at least 13 years old with of course, a valid email address. He developed the Facemash website when he was in his second year of college. The website literally allowed visitors to compare 2 student pictures and let others decide who was more attractive. Unfortunately, later the website was shut down by the Harvard administration because of copyrights and violating individuals privacy. On February 4, 2004 he launched the website under the domain "thefacebook.com". The website could connect people around the university and within the first 24 hours, between 1,200 - 1,500 people have been registered. In 2005 the Facebook domain name was worth $200,000, and by December 2005, it already had 6 million users. Mark Zuckerberg never sold his company and wanted it to stay independent. Today Facebook has 3 billion users and has a value of $1.008 trillion USD.

Windows 8 was developed by Microsoft and released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012, where it was eventually available for download via <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Developer_Network">Microsoft Developer Network</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_TechNet">TechNet</a> on August 15, 2012. The main idea of Windows 8 was to improve user experience on tablet, where Windows had competed with Android and IOS, the mobile running systems. The start screen was based on Microsoft's <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)">Metro</a> design language, integration with online services, Windows Store and a keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Windows 8 included support for Advanced Format, USB 3.0, near-field communication and cloud computing. It was also the first Windows version supporting <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family">ARM architecture</a> under the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT">Windows RT</a> branding.

Overall Windows 8 was accepted negatively because developers seem to hate it, ugly on the desktop, tablet, desktop, smartphone competition and ever more stuff like this. Today still in August 2023, 0.35% of PCs are running Windows 8.

Developed by Microsoft, Windows 8.1 was first revealed at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build">Build 2013</a>,and later went to retail sale on October 17, 2013, which was a free upgrade trough the Windows Store to Windows 8 and Windows RT users. The main reason Windows 8.1 came was because to take all the bad reviews on Windows 8 and solve complaints. They did several improvements, including restoration of the visible Start Button which is on the taskbar, open user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen, Bing-powered connected search system and more bundled apps. Lastly Windows 8.1 now had 3D printing, high-resolution displays, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct">Wi-Fi Direct</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS">ReFS</a> file system and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast">Miracast</a> streaming. It got more positive reviews than last time Windows 8 got, but still was said that Windows 8.1 have some low-level integration between <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)">Metro-</a>style apps and desktop interface, and more stuff like icompatible with newer versions of software. The good reviews was the faster startup and better performance than Windows 8, multitask improvement, costumization features, keyboard and mouse usability was now better and even more.

The latest main release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system was Windows 11, that was released on October 5, 2021. If there was installed Windows 10 on your device, then probably was available Windows 11 for a free download. The Start Menu along with the taskbar were having a new looking and gaming technology was getting better, came the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S">Xbox Series X</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S">Series S</a>. Internet Explorer was replaced with Microsoft Edge as the default web browser, and Microsoft Teams was integrated into the Windows shell. Overall Windows 11 includes a large variety of upgrades, but there are always some naysayers. Its said that its hard getting used to the new Start menu, which is now in the middle for some reason, but I guess its because of the modern design. The useful tools like Timeline, tablet gestures and Action Center are gone, but I overall think its a great Windows version. A beautiful design, strong video gaming features, performance-improving eccentricity and runs on Android apps, but its not necessary to install Windows 11 because Windows 10 kind of has a better performance or I'm wrong.
