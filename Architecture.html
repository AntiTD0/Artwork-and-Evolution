                    These kind of styles were built in the Stone Age, Iron Age and Bronze Age. Most common materials in
                    building were mud, stone and wood, sometimes were just several huge stones to make a shelter. Pretty
                    much prehistoric styles were the minimalism in architecture, even decorations didn't exist. Humans
                    often created megaliths, stone circles and huts. The most mysterious designs are the circle-shaped
                    ones - It has been guessed by archaeologists that the prehistoric people looked to the heavens to
                    replicate the sun and moon. Overall people primarily made them for sheds.

                        In Ancient Egypt architecture, the most known ones are the pyramids. In Egyptian it was called
                        "<i>myr</i>" and due to their shape Egyptians created obelisks on top of the pyramids which is
                        called <i>primordial mound</i>, where they tought that the earth was created this way, including
                        in night time, the dark areas with stars meant to be a physical gateway into the heavens, where
                        the Great Pyramid points towards directly to the center of this part of the sky.
                        There are actually more styles, even containing little towns, palaces, tombs, fortresses and
                        temples. They were made out of locally avaible limestone and mud bricks, but sometimes sandstone
                        and granite. Often in building there were alot of people helping, decorating the walls with
                        hundreds of hieroglyphs and carvings, painted with yellow and brown colors. Pretty much humans
                        were like slaves building these monuments and today these buildings have almost vanished due to
                        sunlight and being near the river Nile, where it have risen a ton over thousands of years, but
                        some of them have survived too, being on high ground and made out of stone which is sufficiently
                        strong not to break in the millenniums.

                        Its received from the ancient Rome-and Greece architecture. There have been alot of different
                        styles of classical architecture existing since the Carolingian-and Italian Renaissance. This
                        style have often used many poles (also called columns), which are sometimes extremely decorated
                        - they are called orders and there are 5 types of them, belonging to ancient Greece. The first
                        one is the Grecian Doric order - Its the most simple one, easily decorated with circular
                        capitals at the top of columns. The second one is the Ionic order - These are pretty detailed
                        ones, used a right angle, straight-edge, a compass and lastly a string to establish
                        half-lenghts. The third one is the Corinthian order - Its the most complex one, combination of
                        Ionic, noted for it's developed capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls. The forth
                        one is the Tuscan order, its the simpliest one and lastly the Composite order which has the most
                        royal looking. For summary the orders are like decoration upgrades and also vocubulary rules,
                        from Tuscan to Composite.

                        Byzantine architecture is the architecture of the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire. When
                        the Roman Empire became Christian, which was extended to east, with its new capital at
                        Constantinople, the architecture became ambitious. The byzantine design is known for it's more
                        exotic, richer in mosaics and large open spaces at the centers of churches. People decided to
                        use bricks and stones as main material, windows as these vivid wonderful golden mosaics to bring
                        light and warmth into the heart of churches, domed roofs and classical forms. Some of the
                        interiors and columns were made out of richer material which was marble.

                        This medieval Europe architecture can occassionally look like a castle, ranging from tiny
                        chapels to cathedrals. In these times there were Carolingian, Merovingian and Ottonian
                        architects who kept building large stone monasteries, churches, palaces with small windows and
                        thick walls. These large buildings primary idea were meant to intimidate and inspire. Some of
                        these buildings used sculpture to illstrate church doctrine and Biblical scenes. For summary the
                        main idea for the Romanesque architecture was to build a statement of wealth and power.

                        Its an architecture style that has envolved from the Romanesque architecture and succeeded
                        Renaissance architecture. These cathedrals and other huge buildings rose to the new heights, the
                        style is litteraly Romanesque but higher ceilings. Gothic style (also known as <i>French
                            style</i>) is originated in the lle-de-France and Picardy regions of northern France, and
                        later became extremely popular due to it's appearance, which is basically a combination of
                        Romanesque architecture. This architecture has never died honestly, because it was reawakened in
                        the 19th and 20th centuries where architects in the United States and Europe designed houses
                        imitating the cathedral architecture which we today also call <i>Gothic Revival</i>.

                        Renaissance is the rebirth of Classical culture that is originated in Florence in the early 15th
                        century which quickly spread to Europe, countries like Germany, France, Spain, England, Russia
                        and other states in Europe.
                        This style followed Gothic architecture and was successful with it's Baroque style. The main key
                        was the classical antiquity, proportion, geometry and symmetry. Renaissance architecture have 3
                        main periods which are Early Renaissance, High Renaissance and Late Renaissance which is also
                        called Mannerism. High Renaissance was the time when these buildings were everywhere beautifully
                        flourishing. There are made several paintings that represent Renaissance architecture and know
                        are one of the most popular ones in the world.

                        Baroque architecture have used many decorations with complex shapes and bold contrasts. The High
                        Baroque was in 1625-1675 when it was used in palaces and churches, including Portugal, France,
                        Spain, Austria and Bavaria, in the late Baroque period which was in 1675-1750, reached all the
                        way to Russia. Baroque architects took several common elements of Renaissance architecture where
                        are domes and colonnades, basically made them taller, more decorated, dramatic and irreverent.
                        Commonly the ceilings had these dramatic light effects made by <a class="link1"

                        Overall this design flourished in the 17-18th century in the central Europe and was one of the
                        larger movements in art and design.

                        Rococo is known as late baroque, another dramatic style of architecture which uses pastel
                        colors, scrolling curves and asymmetry. It began in the 1730s, France and spread to northern
                        Italy, Austria and more other Europe states. Rococo has influenced arts like music, painting,
                        furniture and sculpture. Sometimes the insides of Rococo-styled buildings acted like theatres
                        where there are showed people like they are moving. There are often represented <a class="link1"

                        musical instruments and fruits. The interiors have also used sculptures which were made out of
                        cement, including dragons, angels, monkeys, Chinese people and weird-looking flowers.

                        Neoclassical architecture has blank walls, Roman detail which is Doric and simple geometric
                        forms. There are several designs in Neoclassical architecture, including domed roofs and flat
                        roofs. It began to spread in Europe in the 1750s, and flourished in the 18th, 19th centuries.
                        USA decided to use ancient greek style on the government buildings to make them look like the
                        birthplace of democracy. These classical architectures like Romanesque, Renaissance, Baroque and
                        more, are still in use today, they just have little different names, for example Neoclassical
                        architecture today is called New Classicism. These antique styles are often called "Revivals".

                        Neo-Gothic is simply Gothic Revival where it shows further modernism. People have used Gothic
                        Revival ideas on modern skyscrapers, thats why its called <i>Neo-Gothic</i>. These skyscrapers
                        often have arched and pointed windows, strong vertical lines - they represent height, medieval
                        carvings and little towers which are pinnacles. For example, one of these Neo-Gothic skyscrapers

                        Art Deco firstly appeared in the 1910s which came from France. This style has strongly
                        influenced buildings, ships, bridges, furniture and vehicles. It showed more technology,
                        socialism and luxury, including materials such as ebony, ivory and also some thin craftsmanship.
                        While the World War I was going, it became more unpretentious, so new materials came, containing
                        stainless steel, chrome plating and plastic. Some years later it pretty much failed, some of the
                        buildings were destroyed due to the World War II, so people stopped using this architecture
                        style and the replacement was Modernist architecture.

                        Modernist architecture is known as Modern architecture which uses materials like a huge pile of
                        glass, steel and ferroconcrete (reinforced concrete). The style rejected the details,
                        decorations, classicism and embraced minimalism, including box-shaped design. This architecture
                        emerged in the 1950s and replaced Art Deco architecture due to the WWII. It litteraly became
                        popular because of the simplicity and the classicism removal - replaced with the complete
                        opposite which is technology. There are dozens of styles in Modern Architecture, such as
                        Deconstructivism, Formalism, Structuralism and Brutalism. Overall Modernist Architecture can
                        have the most mysterious designes today which is also called <a class="link1"

                        In the late 1990s, Postmodernism divided into several new 4 groups, containing neo-futurism,
                        high-tech architecture, Deconstructivism and new classical architecture. Postmodernism have
                        mimicked classical and historical-shaped styles on libraries, schools and other buildings, but
                        they still often have unusual materials and the Minimalism look. For summary Postmodernism
                        architecture is the classical revival and occassionally Brutalism, but no ornaments.

                        Neo-Modernism style often uses alot of present-day business-like architecture which is basically
                        Modernism. Its all Modernism architecture which rejects the classical ornamentation, decorations
                        and can even use a really basic design, a box-shaped house polished with white paint.
                        Neo-Modernism began with the 1997 Guggenheim Museum success, and lastly some of this
                        architecture still kind of copies the prehistorical and historical styles, for example <a

                            Resort</a> has pretty similar shape comparing to the <a class="link1"
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>.
