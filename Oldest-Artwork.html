The Egyptic structures used to be one of the largest buildings in the prehistoric period, 1070 - 1550 BCE. This huge temple complex is known as the Amun-re, and does remain as one of the biggest religous buildings in the world. The temple was supposed to be dedicated to mulitple gods, such as Amun-Re, Mut and Montu. The building isn't preserved very well but still gives people much information about the Egyptian art and religion. Built between 1,650 - 2,055 BCE, it included workshops and kitchens. One of the known places there is the Hypostyle Hall, that has 134 massive and thick pillars which are standing at 21 m. The columns were originally decorated with hundreds of vivid paintings and inscriptions, where some of them still exist today on the walls and ceilings.

Most of the bronzes in China are about 2,300 - 3,500 years old, which is also called the Bronze Age. These times were when men learned how to smelt tin and copper to make a different variety of weapons and tools. The bronze discoveries have been made pretty much everywhere but one of the most important ones is the one excavation at the site called Yinxu. In 1928, some deeper excavations of an ancient Chinese site began at Anyang, which is the last capital of the Shang dynasty. Between the excavation years the site has yielded hundreds of oracle bones, grey pottery, bronzes and more. There's overall a huge amount of bronzes discovered, where one of them is in this picture. Its a chunky bronze owl which dates back to 1,200 - 1,300 BCE.

The Priest-King sculpture was found in 1925 by the Indian archaeologist Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in Mohenjo-daro (Mound of the Dead Men) which is a large archaeological city in the third largest county in Pakistan, its Sindh in South Asia. The statue was found at a depth of 1,37 meters, in a small passageway between 2 walls, but the statue has been in it's normal position there and has been mentioned that it rolled or fell into this space as the city slowly collapsed. The Priest-King sculpture is carved in the soft mineral of steatite and is baked at 1000 degrees Celsius. Credits to the artist because the sculpture seems smaller than it actually is, measuring 17.5 cm in high and 11 cm in width. It wears a headband, cloak and a armband where some have mentioned that the statue worships god. It was actually meant to be a bigger statue, might show a seated or kneeling figure and was incomplete. John Marshall named it "Priest-King" and was a success. Its now dated to be over 2,000 BCE which goes back to the Late Mohenjo-daro Period. A replica of the Priest-King is now displayed at the National Museum of Pakistan.

The Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-Daro is a 10.8 cm tall copper-bronze figurine that was found by the archaeologist Ernest MacKay in 1926, it was lying in the ruins in one of the houses in the archaeological site Mohenjo-daro, located in the Sindhi province in Pakistan. Mohenjo-Daro is overall one of the most important sites of the Harappan Civilization, dating back to 1,900 - 2,600 BCE. On the earlier times the statuette was meant to be taller but the feet have came off. The girl, what appears to look like a 15-year old, isn't actually in her dancing pose but resting after a performance. The figurine's same posture was also carved on a piece of red potsherd, that was found in another archaeological site <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhirrana">Bhiranna</a> which is located in the Fatehabad district in north India. For summary, an unknown prehistoric artist used lost-wax casting technique to make this figurine, and dates back to around 2,300 BCE. Its now in the <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_India">National Museum of India</a>.

Its called Maykop culture, it was an archaeological culture in the western Caucasus region which dates back to 3,000 - 3,700 BCE, Bronze Age. The culture was used in Kerch Strait in Eastern Europe, and to the south, where is the Kura River. The Maykop population began to spread from Imereti, a region of Georgia. In 1897, the Russian archaeologist Nikolai Veselovsky was excavating a large burial mound near the village Maikop in northwestern Caucasus. The burial is known as kurgan from the Old Turkic. He was doing his work and then out of nowhere some strange tube-shaped objects, decorated with bulls and animal motifs started to appear while digging. Veselovsky tought that the tubes were nothing much, some random scepters. Then, more than a century was past the discovery, but archaeologists found out that the objects were extremely valuable, old beer straws. When Veselovsky discovered the objects, then later these were indeed analyzed by researchers, but poorly. The researchers didn't think of the tube's complete design, like hollow center and intricate configuration. All the pieces have preserved at the <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_Museum">Hermitage Museum</a>. The straws comprised into a large chamber, divided into 3 compartments, where each contained the body on an adult in the fetal position. All of the straws include 8 composite gold and silver tubes, where all of them are a meter long and 1 cm in diameter, and are weighting about 200 grams. Each of the straws are highly decorated and included a bull or gazelle which measured 7 to 9cm in length. They date back to 2,500 BCE.

A archaeological site called <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Cemetery_at_Ur">Royal Cemetery at Ur</a> lies in the Dhi Qar Governate in southern Iraq. The Ram in a Thicket figurine was discovered by the archaeologist <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Woolley">Leonard Woolley</a> in that site, 1928. Found lying in the Great Death Pit which was one of the graves in Royal Cemetery at Ur. Initially when it was found, the weight of the soil had crushed the huge 45,7 cm figurine into pieces, pretty much it was flat, the body was roughly modelled. Woolley decided using wax to combine the pieces back together and overall the figurine into it's original shape. The statue's head and legs are covered with small amount of gold, but ears were made of copper and shoulders were pure <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>. The statue gives a good impression of the artistic skill of Early Dynastic Mesopotamia's craftspeople, representing wealth, belief and status. For addition, the 12-year excavation at Royal Cemetery at UR has yielded 74 human remains, where most of them were bejewelled women. The sculpture dates back to 2,400 - 2,600 BCE.

It was later bought by Joseph Brummer for an unknown price, and in 1948 he sold it to Alastair Bradley Martin, and owned it with his wife Edith, already a third owner. The statue just stayed on display at the <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Museum">Brooklyin Museum of Art</a> for 59 years until it was sold for $57.2 million at <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> auction house on December 5, 2007.

You probably have heard about the Stonehenge, but there's also a change that you have. Besides that, its the most famous megalithic art in the world now, that is located in the Salisbury Plain which lies in the south western part of central southern England. It was assigned into UNESCO's list of <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">World Heritage Sites</a> in 1986. Archaeologists believe that it was made between 2,000 - 3,000 BCE, then radiocarbon dating mentioned that the <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluestone">bluestones</a> were raised between 2,200 - 2,400 BCE, and its the best answer we have gotten yet. This circular-like 4 meter tall structure was first surveyed in the 1660s by the antiquarian John Aubrey, who incorrectly credited Stonehenge to the much later Celts, where he believed it to be a religious center presided over by Druid priests. There on it was noticed by others and gained it's popularity. It has been estimated that the structure took about 20 million hours to build due to the larger <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsen">sarsen</a> stones that weighted 25 tons, and the smaller ones, bluestones. Its mentioned that dragging all the stones to their place took over 10 years because they were transported to the Marlborough Downs, meaning that the prehistoric people had to drag the stones for 48 kilometers. It is tought that they used like a wooden base, and moved with cylinder-shaped logs where they worked like wheels.

The passage grave at Newgrange is a megalithic tomb situated in the Boyne Valley, that is in the County Meath region in Eastern Ireland. The tomb was discovered way back in 1699 by several workers who were digging for gravel, when eventually some of the workers dug into the side of the tomb and there they found a passage and chamber. The workers were hired by Charles Campbell who was a local landowner, and wanted to dig up a part of Newgrange. As soon as they got their way in to the tomb, there were found lying beads, animal bones and also pieces of glass. Later the discoveries were reported by Edawrd Lhwyd who was a Welsh <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquarian">antiquarian</a>. A little later arrived another visitor Sir Thomas Molyneux who discovered remains of 2 human corpses in the tomb, where both of them were males, one of them was lying farther along the passageway. Molyneux then reported new foundings that Lhwyd had not mentioned. There on dozens of antiquarians started to visit Newgrange and noted about the place. Detailed survey was done in 1769 by Thomas Pownall who examined some rock carvings found as well. In the 1950s, the passageway now had an electric lighting that made the found artifacts visible to visitors. Then a more extensive excavation was conducted in 1962 and lasted 13 years. The excavation report was written by Michael J.O'Kelly, and was published in 1982 by Thames and Hudson, entitled as <i>Archaeology, Art and Legend</i>. Overall the chamber contains rock engravings, for example one of them shows a <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion">Triskele</a> pattern which is situated in the end of the chamber, and more stuff, like a chiselled granite basin located in the east, side-chamber. The mound is 85 m wide, 12 m high and was built by the people from the Neolithic period, which dates back to 3,200 BCE.

Valdivia is a city or commune in southern Chile which is in the region of Valdivia. There are multiple of these figurines, measuring from 4 to 20 centimeters in height, and carved out of block of clay. Later they were painted and polished. There is a huge controversy behind the figurines, nobody knows which of them are the real ones. There are rumours that the excavations began in the 1950s, while some figurines and artifacts were found, but some looters would quickly use their level 100 skills, go for it and take the figurines, and then locals began making the same looted objects where they sold them to archaeologists and tourists. So this whole situation was to make evil business off the archaeologists and other people. Pretty much people have been doing alot of copying and evil business, some of them would rob the real discovered figurines and then even make copies out of them, so they can sell them back to archaeologists. It has been mentioned that there are more Valdivia figurines in museums than were excavated by archaeologists. At least the excavated ones were used by people from the Valdivia culture of South America, which dates back to 3,500 BCE. The people lived in small family huts where they made cooking and tools which means they were mainly focused on their home lives.

The cave is situated almost on the mouth of the Verlorenvlei estuary, which is on the Atlantic coast of South Africa's Western Cape Province. The cave is probably known for centuries, but the first investigations didn't begun until the 1970s by John Parkington who obviously showed some interest in that cave, because the excavations were going for several years. Between the excavation period, so in 1997 he and another archaeologist Caroline Cartwright excavated over 6,700 fragments of wood charcoal in total, they were given through dry sieving big soil samples of 39 collections. The excavation periods have yielded some handprints as well, some of them made by teenagers and other young children who were hunter-gatherers. Along with the handprints are drawn some animals too, dating back to 4,000 BCE. For summary, the excavations have yielded tons of artifacts, like animal bones, charcoal remains and ostrich egg shells, dating back somewhere to the Neolithic era.

These images of giraffes are situated on the western side of Aïr Massif which is in northern Niger, the montains are only few kilometers away from the Trans-Saharan Highway. Its not exactly told how these were discovered but the first recording was done by Christian Dupuy in 1987, and 10 years later, David Coulsen documented the engravings. There are represented 2 giraffes where one of them is a male and other one is a female who is smaller. First when I looked at the photo then tought that its another medium-sized engraving but no, the giraffes are about 5.4 meters tall, making them the biggest engravings in the world, along with 828 surrounding images where 704 of them are animals, like antelopes, rhinoceroses, camels, cattles, ostriches, elephants, crocodiles, a lion and more smaller giraffes. The other ones show humans and petroglyphs that are between 6,000 to 8,000 years old. It is unknown who the artists were, but the detail in the giraffes was pretty well done.

These engravings are located around the city Sidney which is in the New South Wales state in Australia. Now the engravings have never been a large discovery, but the Sydney region is known because of it's huge collection of rock art, including animals, abstract signs and human figures. Its like an art place where people have been giving illustrations from different periods where the oldest one is the Mesolithic period. The site contains alot of new engravings as well, for example there are seen European sailing ships that are only 200 years old, but also some ancient ones where one of the drawings shows a fish, that dates back to 5,000 - 7,000 BCE. There are represented Tasmanian tigers who are now extinct, dancing people, whales, fish and more other known animals which were made with a sharp stone. There could be also evidence that some of the engravings have vanished because of the sandstone that makes the drawings easy to fade.

Lepenski Vir. Its a site that has been searched by the archaeologists for years, and is located in Serbia. It was found in 1969, by Dragoslav Srejović who was one of the archaeologists in a group which contained diggers. The excavations were going on the right bank of river Danube, situated in Lepenski Vir where lies dozens of ancient villages. Over the years there are discovered 136 residental buildings, dating back to 5,500 - 7,200 BCE. The houses have yielded dead people as well, some skeletons of children were found under certain well preserved floors. The site itself was discovered on August 30, 1960 by Manoljo Milošević who was a local farmer, but the first excavations didn't begin until 1963, when an archaeological exploration was organized by the Belgrade Institute for Archaeology, but a large construction of the <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Gate_I_Hydroelectric_Power_Station">Iron Gate | Hydroelectric Power Station</a> was gonna come, and it would flood the bank parts with it's artificial lake, so they wanted explore as fast and much as possible. In 1961, before the excavations, the area yielded a ton of ceramic fragmants which are from the Starčevo Culture, dating back to 4,200 - 6,500 BCE. For summary, the main excavations were going from 1965 to 1970, which have given houses along with about 100 fish statues where some of them are over 30 centimeters tall. The sculptures are carved out of quartz sandstone and all them combined dates back to 2,000 - 6,000 BCE. The statues are represented as fishes because Lepenski Vir is rich in fish overall.

This little 11.4-centimetre tall, dark gray, polished figurine along with a second sculpture was found in a graveyard settlement debris which is near the town Cernavodă, that is in Northern Dobruja, a part on the border of Romania. The graveyard consists over 400 graves where the 2 figurines were found, they are called "The Thinker" and "Sitting Woman". These were made by the Hamangia people who used to bury their dead in special places which are also called "necropolises", meaning "city of dead" in ancient Greek. The burials not only contained these 2 small statuettes, but one cup, a shell bracelet and even a small amount of gold. The items dates back to 4,600 - 5,000 BCE along with figurines which were carved out of <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta">terracotta</a>. The sculptures show what you see, its a man sitting on a stool who is almost sad and thinking about something, while the Sitting Woman or Seated Woman is doing pretty much the same thing, but kneels on one knee. Some have suggested tho, that the Seated Woman has injured her knee, thats why the figurine is in a rare position according to the ancient times. But who discovered it? - In 1956, when a team archaeologists began excavating at the graveyard, there appeared a tomb which was collapsed and inside were the 2 statuettes. The excavation was led by Dumitru Berciu who was the discoverer.

Most of the Chalcolithic ceramics were excavated in southern Persia, Iran. The prehistoric pottery was recovered from Tepe Sialk which is near the Ebrahimabad village, central plateau of Iran. The excavations started in 1967 and ended in 1986, where the site has yielded several handmade Tal-i Iblis red-coloured ceramics that were well done in fire. The pots were usually painted with simple red geometric designs in Persia. There isn't much posted about the discovery but the ceramics in Iran divides into 3 periods - Early, Middle and Late Chalcolithic periods, dating back to 3,300 - 5000 BCE. The pots often used predominant shapes, slightly everted rim and the base was either ring or flat. The picture doesn't show the discovered pots because the source wasn't found, but its an example of a Chalcolithic pot in Iran.

         Jiahu is another archaeological site in the Yellow River basin of Henan region in central China, 22 km north of the city Wuyang. In 1962, some 9 pottery kilns were found by Zhu Zhi, but the longer excavations begun in 1983 to 1987, led by Zhang Juzhong. The diggings have yielded tons of artifacts from the Neolithic period, including pottery, turquoise carvings, bone flutes, kilns, stone and bone tools. In Jiahu, over 31 flute fragments were found in the burials, where 6 of them represented one of the earliest playable music instruments discovered. The site included some tortoiseshells, where on their surface are made several <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictogram">pictograms</a>, dating back to 3,500 BCE, and overall the flutes along with stone tools dates back to at least 7,000 BCE.

                        Çatalhöyük is a whole ancient city-like archaelogical site that overlooks the Konya Plain, southeast of the city Konya which is located in southearn Anatolia, central Turkey. It has been added to UNESCO World Heritage Site since July 2012. In 1961, a team of archaeologists began exploring 2 small hills at Çatalhöyük, and then later an archaeologist James Mellaart was interested in the 2 hills, and tought that the hills are hiding something, and he wasn't wrong. After 4 years of examinations and diggings, the hills have given 14 different occupations and many limeplaster houses. In 1993, a British archaeologist Ian Hodder intended to develop a large research project at Çatalhöyük, which lasted for 25 years, (ended in 2018). Over the years they have found that the houses were used to be tidy and inhibited for 1,500 years. The humans lived there in the Copper Age which dates back to 5,500 BCE. The site has included murals and coloured pots as well, dating back to 5,700 - 7,500 BCE. One of the murals shows a polka-dotted shape which is above a series of boxes, and the shape is a volcanic eruption. Later in 2013, the volcanologist Axel Schmitt proved that the polka-dotted shape is the Hasan Daği volcano which lies 128 km (80 miles) northeast of Çatalhöyük. The eruption was 9,000 years ago, pretty much at the same time when the mural was painted. It also might be the oldest painted map because the boxes are represented as the village. For summary, the village contained 5,000 to 7,000 people, along with murals where are shown stuff like animals where the oldest age can be 10,000 years.

                        Cueva de las Manos is a site that is located about 160 kilometers south of Perito Monero which
                        is in Southern Patagonia, it overlooks the Rio Pinturas canyon. The Cave of Handstencils was
                        first seen in 1941 by a monk, and later in 1949 the cave was explored by the researcher Rex
                        Gonzalez who didn't spot any cave art. This, more like a small rock shelter that extends 25
                        meters into the hillside, was actually archaeologically examined in the late 1960s, and later
                        discovering several hundred hand stencils and animal representations led it to UNESCO World
                        Heritage site declare in 1999. Overall this rock shelter, not a cave, has indeterminate quantity
                        of images where 90% of them are hand stencils/prints, several abstract signs along with some
                        animals like rheas, guanacos, felines and other known animals that are made with different
                        variety of pigments. The rock shelter was occupied by Modern humans where they made over 2,000
                        stencils, and the art was dated back to between 7,300 - 7,500 BCE.

Tassili-n-Ajjer is referred as a park in the middle of a large plateau in southeastern Algeria, over 10 kilometers southwest is the Djanet town which is located in the Sahara desert. The site that is at the borders of Niger, Lybya and Mali, has been declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982 by Gonde Hontigifa due to it's huge collection of artwork. The discovery was made by a camel corps officer Lieutenant Brenans in 1933, after spotting the rock art he began to write down the details of the engravings and paintings. Later it triggered the archaeologist Henri Lhote with fellow Frenchman to make a deep study of the rock art which lasted for 16 months. About 2 years later Lhote published a book titled "<i>la découverte des fresques du Tassili</i>", its one of the most popular books today that talks about archaelogical discovery. The rock art has been reported by Lhote, where published reproductions of the engravings and paintings he found on the rock walls. The Running Horned Woman is one of the known engravings that shows a female figure running with her 2 large horns, including some slightly visible smaller figures surrounding her. There are 2 other known paintings - "Crouching giraffe giving birth" and "Archers". Overall the artwork dates back to around 8,000 BCE.

The 140m deep cave remains as an archaeological site, a cavity in the dolomite rocks of the Kuruman Hills, which is located 43 km south of Kuruman, its basically near the village Wonderwerk, South Africa. The first discoveries were in the 1940s, when some local farmers were removing soil from the cave interior to use it for fertilizing. One of them spotting animal bones under the soil, and there on a huge amount of archaeological excavations have been going in that cave since 1940s, meaning that the cave has yielded a large amount of prehistoric items over the years. Wonderwerk Cave is famous due to it's large set of 1-2 million year old tools. The lower sedimentary layers have offered simple chopping <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldowan">Oldowan tools</a> which were made out of flaked stones, and dated back to about 2 million years. There are found ash along with burnt bone remains that could be evidence of the earliest use of fire, but we are here for the engravings. The pleistocene engravings and paintings are near the cave's entrance walls, found on one of the excavation periods and dating back to Neolithic era, about 8,200 BCE. There was a small stone containing incised lines, <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideogram">ideograms</a>, animal engravings and several geometric designs which are currently being examined by David Morris.

The hill station Pachmarhi is in the Narmadapuram division which lies in the Madhya Pradesh state in central India. The region is overall rich in caves and rock shelters that are near the town of Narmadapuram, located 1,132 m above the sea level. Between 1867 and 1868, Archibald Carlleyle discovered some rock paintings on the walls and roof in some of the caves in Sohagighat which is situated in the Mirzapur District. He just left this knowledge to himself and did not publish for some reason. In 1957, the father of Indian rock art Vishnu Shridhar Wakankar discovered Bhimbetka which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After this discovery, alot became interested and decided to explore the other caves in Madhya Pradesh, including Narwar, Chiklod, Adamgarh, Nagori-Sanchi, Firangi and more rock shelters which brought the paintings to light. Overall Madhya Pradesh contains alot of caves that have paintings, dating back to 3,000 - 9,000 BCE. One of the caves in Adamgarh have a total of 11 rock shelters, where one of them have paintings that are faded in time, but at least 2, still visible representations of a deer with 12 horns and a horse with forelegs in the air, painted in dark grey pigments. The other rock shelters include more animals, like deers, cows, elephants, a giraffe, bulls and more. This picture shows one of the rock shelters were are represented human sacrifice. They are called "Head Hunters" who are dancing.

The Ain Sakhri Lovers is a Late Epipaleolithic 10cm tall sculpture that was discovered in the Ain Sakhri caves. There are several caves located near the city Bethlehem which lies 10 km south of Jerusalem. In 1933, when the French consul René Neuville was at Bethlehem with Abbé Breuil, while visiting a small museum, Neuville found a little stone that immediately looked like a figurine, and he was right. Later he was led to the Ain Sakhri caves, noticing that this figurine was from the same cave and it also got it's name from there. The excavations have revealed that the caves were used by the humans from Neolithic period and the sculpture hadn't been gone out in other states, so it was used domestically. The Shakri Lovers figurine, made out calcite cobble and dating back to 9,000 BCE, is at the British Museum since 1958.

                        Its a site situated 45 km northwest of Göbekli Tepe, about 500 meters above sea level, on the
                        lower level of Taurus Mountains which are next to the Kantara stream. The site was first
                        investigated in 1983 by a team from the University of Heidelberg which led by Professor Harald
                        Hauptmann, and ended in 1991. Its known for it's one of the oldest carved monoliths in the world
                        which dates back to between 8,400 - 9,200 BCE. However the site hasn't been a discovery, it was
                        only when the excavations began in the 1990s when they found another area under the site which
                        was flooded, and several small clay 5cm in height figurines that were fired at low temperatures.
                        Overall this site has yielded numerous artifacts, carvings and small figurines, and dating back
                        to 9,000 BCE.

                        This statue is known for one of the oldest sculptures made of a human. It was found near the
                        site of Urfa, Yeni-Yol street which is in Balikligöl. It was in 1993 when constructions were
                        going in the Yeni Mahalle Höyügü division - its a building site that lies in the ancient town
                        centre of Sanliurfa, on a random day when they were working on landscape, there randomly
                        appeared a life-sized statue, and recovering the sculpture showed it's 1.9 meters of height. It
                        has deeply incised eyes and nose, but no mouth. This statue has a message behind it because its
                        holding hands on his genitals, head turned slightly to the right, and it has no legs which means
                        that it was meant to a pedestal in a socket. It might one of the statues from Göbekli Tepe, at
                        least it looks similar to one of the sculptures found in Göbekli Tepe. For summary this statue
                        is now in a museum located in Urfa, and is dated back to 9,000 BCE.

                        Göbekli Tepe is located 20 kilometers northeast of Urfa, its on a limestone plateau which
                        overlooks the Harran plain, in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. It was discovered by
                        the German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt in 1994, when he first saw something, he knew had
                        stumbled across something big. The excavations began the following year and lasted until Schmidt
                        passed away. This site now has a whole brand new visitor centre with parking lots. The site is
                        known for it's late Cro-Magnons built structures that are circular-shaped areas where are
                        several giant megaliths. It has alot of engravings aswell, like wild sheeps, bulls, donkeys,
                        foxes, boars and more. It has been tought that this structure was never meant for daily living,
                        because there was no water nearby. The site has also yielded numerous animal bones, so it tells
                        us that the structure was used by some full-time hunter-gatherers, where they gathered together
                        to create a sacred venue for collectings and ceremonies. Overall the site has been dated to
                        between 8,000 - 9,500 BCE.

                        This figurine is also known as <i>The Lady of Monruz</i>, that was discovered on July 26, 1990
                        at Monruz which is in the county of Neuchatel, Switzerland. It was found buried under 5 meters
                        of sand, clay and gravel along with other animal bones and flint tools. To be exact, the
                        discovery place lies on the north-western, near the Lake Neuchatel which is along with Jura
                        mountains, its also known as the Magdalenian hunters' camp. This venus stands 1.6 cm in height,
                        carved out of jet (hard coal), and was polished. Some have suggested that it's appearance is a
                        seated woman, and is also pretty similar to the Petersfels Venuses. It has a hole because it was
                        possibly meant to be worn as an amulet, and could have been the same artist who created the
                        Petersfels Venuses. It was dated to be close to 10,000 BCE.

                        This sculpture which may have stood more than 5 meters, was discovered on January 24, 1890, it
                        was 4 meters deep in the peat bog of Shigir which is on the eastern slope of the Middle Urals,
                        and is near the village of Kalata. It was later dissambled into 10 pieces and then the land
                        owner Count Alexey Stenbok-Fermor donated the fragments to a local museum where Professor Dmitry
                        Lobanov reassembled the figurine and stood 2.8 meters in height. In 1914, another archaeologist
                        came up with a idea to include the unused fragments, which raised the figure's height to 5.3
                        meters. The first dating was in the 1990s, when Shigir Idol was carbon dated by the Institute of
                        the History for the Material Culture which is in Saint Petersburg, where it gave a date of 7,500
                        BCE. In 2014, new tests were taken by the Germany experts from the Department of Cultural
                        Heritage of Lower Saxony, where they gave this carving a date of 9,500 BCE. Then finally the
                        dating was confirmed in 2021, when scientists from the University of Göttingen, and Institute of
                        Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences published the result which was 10,000 BCE.

                        It is divided into 2 caves, Addaura I and II, they are situated on the slope of Mount Pellegrino
                        which is on the northern suburbs of Palermo. This site contains 3 caves from east to west, they
                        are Cave of Antro Nero, Cave of Incisions and Addaura Caprara. The Cave of Incisions was
                        discovered right after World War II, when the explosions revealed the cave entrance which is now
                        9 meters deep and 3 meters high. The cave art however, was discovered by archaeologists Luigi
                        Bernabo Brea and Jole Bovio Maroni in 1952. The following year Marconi published the reportings
                        of the engravings. Then in 1954, the entrance to the cave Grotta Niscemi was found, where it
                        contained even more rock engravings and carvings of animals, this cave is located in the south.
                        The Cave of Incisions has the engraving called "Human Sacrifice Dance Scene", that shows ibexes,
                        bisons, aurochs, wild horses and a deer in the middle of a group where are represented human
                        figures dancing around prostate victims who are focused on the scene. In total of 16 figures are
                        shown, where one of them is a female and 2 shamans. The art was dated back to the late
                        Magdalenian period and is around 10,000 BCE.

                        This figurine was found in 2 pieces by the French engineer Peccadeau de I'Isle in 1866 while he
                        was trying to dig for artifacts beneath the rock overhang of Abri Montastruc which is below the
                        castle of Bruniquel that overlooks the River Aveyron. The Montastruc is another rock shelter
                        where he found the sculpture 7 meters below the surface. Later the reporting of the discovery
                        led this sculpture to exhibition at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Years went by and after
                        some long negotiations, De I'Isle's reindeer sculptures were sold to the British Museum in 1887,
                        and cost a total of £500. Then in 1904, Abbe Henri Breuil realized that the 2 pieces would fit
                        together, and he was right. The sculpture was now 22 cm in length which is also carved out of
                        woolly mammoth ivory using different stone tools, and was later decorated with incised details
                        with polishing. This masterpiece was dated back to 11,000 BCE.

                        This cave is in the commune of Rouffignac-Saint-Cernin-de-Reilhac which is in the Dordogne
                        department, France. The cave's network is over 10 kilometers of passages where they spread into
                        3 levels, the top level has most of the art. The cave first mentioned in 1575 by Francois de
                        Belleforest, in his <i>Cosmographie universelle</i> he wrote "paintings and animal traces". In
                        the 19th century this cave has been known as a tourist attraction. Henri Breuil, Edouard-Alfred
                        and Andre Glory have visited this cave aswell, but the real discovery was in 1956 when
                        Louis-Rene Nougier and Romain Robert confirmed the cave art. Rouffignac Cave has some really
                        visible engravings and charcoal drawings, containing 224 animal representations and 4 human
                        figures. 70% of the animals are mammoths, (158 of them), 12 ibexes, 15 horses, 10 woolly
                        rhinoceroses, 28 bisons and a single cave bear, including some finger flutings at the start of
                        the Desbordes panel, which is called "chamber A1". The artwork is done pretty well, because the
                        cave has been occupied by the Magdalenian humans. These creatures were basically modern day
                        humans, so that's why they were some skilled artists. Most of the archaeologists have dated the
                        artwork to be 11,000 BCE, which is the most less wrong answer we have today.

                        Lingjing is an open-air site which is in east-central that is about 120 km south of the Yellow
                        River, China. The figurine was discovered in 2005, while excavating by an international team of
                        archaeologists, led by Dr.Zhanyang Li from the Shandong University. The excavations identified
                        11 distict layers, ranging from age 2,500 - 116,000 BCE. This tiny-scaled figurine was in layer
                        5, along with several stone tools, ostrich shells, pottery and charcoal fragments. The sculpture
                        can stand by itself with its 1.9cm of size. To give a date to this sculpture, was to send 3
                        burnt bone samples to the Beta Analytic Testing Laboratory which is Miami, giving a number of
                        between 11,300 - 11,400 BCE.

                        Its a cave which is almost 3 kilometers from the commune of Les Eyzies de Tayac, that is in the
                        Dordogne department in France. Its actually a site that contains 2 caves where one of them is
                        the "<i>Drinking Reindeer</i>", and the other one is smaller, Combarelles II. The cave network
                        consists long narrow passages where there's space for only one person at a time. Les Combarelles
                        Cave was first discovered in September 1901 by pre-historians Louis Capitan, Abbe Breuil and
                        Denis Peyrony, but the art was found later by Monsieur Berniche who duly sought the advice of
                        archaeologists, the 3 pre-historians who discovered the cave (Henri Breuil, Denis Peyrony and
                        Louis Capital). The scientists after studied the parietal art and confirmed that it is from the
                        Magdalenian era. In 1924, the cave discoverer trio published a joint monograph on the artwork at
                        Les Combarelles, which also included the <i>Drinking Reindeer</i> engraving. The engraving is an
                        adult reindeer who is streching forward to catch some water from the wall crack (this picture
                        shows). Overall this cave has about 600 seperate engravings, including <a class="link1"
                            href="https://artslookup.com/prehistoric/tectiform-sign.html">tectiforms</a> and abstract
                        signs, but unfortunately many of the engraved drawings have faded. The given date to the art was
                        11,700 BCE.

                        Santimamine Cave is located near the Kortezubi town which is in the Biscay territory, lies in
                        the Basque Country, Spain. The cave was initially discovered by a group of boys who reported
                        their finds to local composer Jesus Guridi, who informed the Bizkaia authorities. The
                        archaeological excavations had begun the following year, and ended in 1962, including
                        archaeologists Enrique Eguren, Telesforo de Aranzadi and Jose Miguel de Barandiaran. In the
                        excavation period the cave has yielded dozens of rock engravings and paintings of 50 seperate
                        animal figures, where most of the cave art is 50 meters from the entrance. In total there are 32
                        bisons, 6 horses, 7 ibexes, a stag, 1 brown bear and 3 unknown figures. Almost all of them are
                        made with black charcoal and are medium, small-sized pictures. This dates to the final phase of
                        Upper Paleolithic art, and is about 12,000 BCE.

                        This cave has been added to the World Heritage Site since July 2008, and noticed for it's
                        prehistoric cave paintings. Its located in the Guipuzcoan county of Deva which is in the Basque
                        Country, Spain. Ekain Cave was discovered in 1969 by the members of the Antxieta Cultural
                        Association of Azpeitia - Andoni Albizuri and Rafael Rezabal, then later the first
                        archaeological investigations were made by Jose Miguel de Barandiaran and Jesus Altuna. They
                        have found Chatelperronian period human activity (40,000 - 45,000 BCE), and the cave paintings
                        are much newer, but at least in the Magdalenian era. The cave consists 70 painted animal figures
                        where 6 of them are engraved. More than half of them are horses, some rhinoceroses, fishes,
                        deers and bears. It has 6 different chambers - Erdialde, Zaldei, Azkenzaldei, Erdibide, Auntzei
                        and Artzei. The Zaldei room is basically the main chamber where are represented horses, and the
                        other chambers have different variety of animals where some of them are outlined with charcoal,
                        some drawn in black and red. The artwork dates back to the final period of Stone Age which is
                        close to 12,000 BCE.

                        This cave is known for it's Cro-Magnons occupation whose art belongs in that cave which is the
                        Magdalenian art, and one of the most large-scaled sites in the Basque region of Spain. Its a
                        site near the town of Lequeitio which is like a coastal corridor between San Sebastian and
                        Bilbao. Diego Garate and Joseba Rios-Garaizar discovered the cave art in 2015, when they went
                        deeper into the cave, finding a total about 100 painted engravings of animals, and that belongs
                        to the Upper Magdalenian era. Later the Department of Euskera and Culture of the Provincial
                        Council of Vizcaya announced a 5-year study, to research this cave. It has 2 entries, one is 7
                        meters up from the ground level, and the other one is at the ground level where the gallery runs
                        for close to 300 meters, and the upper gallery runs for 800 meters. Atxurra Cave has 113 animal
                        figures where are the one gallery room which is the "Bison Room", that is 235 meters from the
                        entrance. The second is the "Horse Platform", located 4 meters above the ground level, includes
                        about 40 engraved drawings where most of them are horses. The artwork was made using flint
                        tools, charcoal, wooden torches, some raw materials for their pigments, and overall is dated
                        back to 10,500 - 12,500 BCE.

                        Le Portel Cave is inside the Ariege Pyrenees Regional Nature Park which is in the commune of
                        Loubens, France. Originally the cave was discovered in March, 1908 by Dr R.Jeannel and
                        G.Fauveau, and some days later they found some galleries. Felix Regnault found the Gallery of
                        the Horses and Henri Breuil the Gallery of the bison. Vezian family has been studying Le Portel
                        cave for years, and have taken a good care of the site. This cave has 2 levels where the River
                        Carol flows trough the lower level. However if you go to the upper level, then there appears the
                        3 main halls, one is left which is 100 meters long - contains the Main Gallery, second is in the
                        middle, 50 meters long - Horses Gallery, and the last one is one the right, 70 meters long -
                        Bison Gallery. For summary this cave in total has close to 140 paintings and engravings made by
                        the Magdalenian artists, the artwork contains black drawings, engraved animals which are
                        painted, bird-like figures, Camarin niche in the Bison Gallery and male figures and phalluses
                        that were dated to 12,500 BCE.

                        Its a site that lies in the tight Brudertal valley going from the Danube to a low pass in the
                        Swabian Jura, over the River Rhine. The discovery was made by Eduard Peters who was a retired
                        postman and Volker Toepfer, while excavating, they were finding tons of animal bones, stone,
                        antler and bone tools. The excavation was in 1927-1932. Over the years they have recovered tons
                        of stone tools, including several small-scaled carvings. Then in 1974 to 1979 Gerd Albrecht
                        decided to re-excavate the site, and also recovered numerous Stone Age artifacts. The are
                        multiple female carving found where the biggest one is the Venus of Engen, which is a 4cm tall
                        sculpture that is referred as "femmes sans tete", (females with no heads), often characterized
                        by semi-abstract bodies. It is from the Madgalenian era and given a date of 13,000 BCE.

                        The Grotte de Gabillou is located in the commune of Sourzac which is in the department of
                        Dordogne, France. Literally a house have stood in the cave entrance for decades, so no one
                        couldn't get to the cave until the house collapsed that led to the main cave passage. The art
                        discovery was in 1940, when M. Charmarty and M.Truffier went to the collapsed house basement
                        that led them to the main cave, and pretty much immediately reported several art finds, and were
                        announced to the Historical and Archaeological Society of Perigord. As I said the cave is only
                        accessible via the basement of the house, and researchers can go there with appropriate
                        qualifications. The cave contains 3 known chambers which are the "Chamber of the Red Horse", the
                        "Choke Point", and the "Chamber of the Hare", but all the rock art is in the main passage,
                        Gabillou. There are found approximately 200 engraved drawings where quarter of them are horses,
                        18 birds, 8 ibexes, 21 reindeers, numerous rabbits, bears, including a important one which shows
                        a woman giving birth, and the other known is the "Sorcerer", that shows a part animal and human
                        figurine with horns and beard. There are multiple abstract signs found aswell which are dated
                        back to 13,000 BCE. In 1955 the house and land containing the cave was bought by Jean Gaussen
                        who published a book about paleoart in 1964. This cave has been historic monument since 20 July
                        1942.

                        The Niaux Cave is situated in the northern foothills of the Pyrenees, its embedded in the
                        steep-sided valley of Vicdessos which overlooks the Ariege River that runs trough the Tarascon
                        basin. The cave is actually known from year 1602, but the real discovery was in 1906 when a
                        retired military engineer Commander Molard and his 2 sons, Paul and Jules discovered rock art in
                        the Salin Noir which is a cathedral sanctuary at the centre of the cave. Several months went by
                        and archaeologists Emile Cartailhac and Henri Breuil became interested, so they went to visit
                        the cave and determined that the animal images dates back to the Magdalenian era, which made
                        this cave instantly more famous. Another gallery was discovered in 1925 by J.Mandeman who named
                        it Cartailhac Gallery. The last discovery was by 2 local potholers in 1970, when they found
                        multiple images named "Reseau Rene Clastres gallery", and there on Robert Simonnet and Jean
                        Clottes became interested aswell. If you enter the cave then there's no cave art at all for at
                        least 500 metres, but if you go deeper, there appears some red and black abstract signs. There
                        are dozens of different shaped signs which are made with charcoal and ochre. This cave includes
                        many gallery halls, the first one is the Gallery of the Scree - located in the left, and shows
                        aurochs. The second one is the Reseau Rene Clastres gallery which is on the right side, and
                        contains 3 bisons, a horse, 1 weasel and footprints made with charcoal. The last one is the
                        Salon Noir, lies in the right, top of a steep and wide slope which is a large cathedral-like
                        place at centre of the entire site. Overall Niaux Cave has 3 galleries, but there are pretty
                        much art everywhere, mainly seperate images of animals. The dating is not confirmed but
                        radiocarbon dating gave it a age of 10,000 - 15,000 BCE.

                        Its a cave located in the county of Montesquieu-Avantes which is in the Ariege department of
                        southwest France. Tuc d'audobert Cave was again discovered by the three sons of Comte Begouen,
                        along with their friend Francois Camel. This cave is actually almost connected to the Trois
                        Freres Cave, meaning that they have found 2 known caves at the same time, both were discovered
                        on the same year. It was on 20 July 1912, when the group decided to explore the resurgence of
                        Volp, they made a raft for it. Trois Freres and Tuc d'Audobert are slightly connected, so they
                        still could get past a narrow corridor which led them to the cave, and pretty much immediately
                        discovering a gallery of animals, like bisons. 2 bison reliefs were modelled in clay by some
                        master artists, along with some finger flutings and a stone tool which was spatula-shaped one.
                        The relief was set on a 1.5 meters long rock, 80cm wide and 58cm high, fallen from the ceiling.
                        The male bison is slightly behind the female one, which is known as mating scene. Both bisons
                        are about 60 cm long, containing still visible finger marks on the back of them. Overall there
                        are more bison reliefs found there, including The Little Bison, it was a little sculpture
                        standing on the block where the 2 bisons were found, unfortunately it was accidentally knocked
                        onto the floor by a person who found it, but didn't break, so its now on display at the Musee
                        d'Archeologie Nationale. Lastly a more engraved bisons, 3 of them engraved into walls, other one
                        was engraved the same block, and a bison's head which was a normal sketch deeply incised. Dating
                        of the artwork is close to 13,000 BCE.

                        named after the 3 sons, but in that time they found dozens engravings of animals like the main
                        animals like bisons, horses, mammoths and other more stuff. In the 1920s, 1930s, Abbe Henri
                        Breuil decided to explore the cave, making drawings of the engravings that were widely
                        published. In 1958 R.Beogouen and Breuil published a monograph on the hundreds of images carved
                        on the walls of the gallery, its now also known as the "Sanctuary". Overall this cave is known
                        for it's 1300 images which more than half found in Ariege region. There are 9 main galleries
                        that include hand stencils, finger flutings, abstract signs, engravings and paintings. All the
                        galleries - Hall of the Fallen Rocks, Hands Gallery, Chapel of the Lioness, The Sanctuary,
                        Gallery of Owls, Salle des Gours, Galerie de L'Hemione, Salle du Theatre and Gallery of Dots.

                        Roc-aux-Sorciers is a mid-Madgalenian cultural rock shelter located in the French village of
                        Angles-sur-I'Anglin, lies in Vienne, and has been classified as a historical monument since 18th
                        January 1955. Its another archaeological site where belong two caves, one of them is Abri
                        Bourdois - the main cave where the frieze was discovered, and the second one, where are a number
                        of engravings, its little bit deeper - Taillebourg. Initially these caves were investigated in
                        1888 by Mr. Sabourin, and in 1892 by Father Pingeault, they were focusing on Mousterian
                        sediments. The real discovery was in 1927, when a local archaeologist Lucien Rousseau was
                        excavating the Taillebourg Cave, he stumbled across a stone block where was an engraved mammoth,
                        and then 6 years went by until finally he published his findings. In 1947 the exploration began
                        under a French prehistorican Suzanne Cassou de Saint-Mathurin and Dorothy Garrod. They explored
                        the site for 7 years, finding engravings of animals where multiple of them are painted on one of
                        the first excavations. In 1950 was discovered a new engraving which was a horse carved on the
                        rear wall of the shelter, this led to discovery the entire 18-metre frieze of animals. Later
                        Saint-Mathurin and Garrod published their articles and studies of Roc-aux-Sorciers, and then the
                        site became historical monument. The frieze has horses, bisons, felines and ibexes, (total of 34
                        figures), measuring 20 meters in length and 2.6m in height.

                        This 15cm tall figurine was discovered in 1930 by K.M. Polikarpovich, in the Bryansk region of
                        Russia where lies the Sudost River. There are two archaeological sites in Eliseevichi which are
                        "Eliseevichi 1" and "Eliseevichi 2". The first one have yielded over 200 artifacts, including
                        the female ivory statuette. This figurine was found to be not even similar to the other
                        figurines found in Russia, such as Avdeevo Venuses and Venuses of Kostenki, it has a more
                        realistic human shape, because some years later Magdalenians got better at carving. The figurine
                        was carved out of mammoth ivory and was dated to be about 13,000 BCE.

There are multiple of these Stone Age pots found in 1835 by the American zoologist Edward S. Morse, while he was excavating in Omori shell-mound which is on the border of Shingawa and Ōta, Tokyo, Japan. He didn't discover whole pots but sherds that had some twisted cords on their outer surfaces. He named them "Jomon" which is now widely used to characterize enitre Japanase art culture. Some of the sherds were from the Middle Jomon period which dates back to between 1,500 - 2,500 BCE. These purely hand ceramics were made with pure hands, and fired at 600 degrees Celsius. Overall all of the fragments combined dates back to 1,000 - 14,500 BCE, consisting 6 different Jomon periods, click <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jomon_culture#:~:text=The%20sub-periods%20are%3A%201%20Incipient%20Jomon%2013000-8000%20B.C.E.,Final%20%28Latest%29%20Jomon%201000-300%20B.C.E.%20or%201000%E2%80%93500%20B.C.E.">here</a> to see all the periods.

                        Cap Blanc rock shelter which is called "<i>L'Abri du Cap Blanc</i>", is on a sudden wooded
                        hillside located in the Beune valley, almost 9 kilometers east of Les Eyzies. This rock shelter
                        was originally discovered in 1908 by several workmen. They were employed to excavate the cave by
                        Dr.Gaston Lalanne of Bordeaux. The engraved sculptures were noticed until some damage had been
                        made by their pickaxes. 3 months later most of the Stone Age sculptures were uncovered. Then in
                        1911 a professional archaeologist Denis Peyrony came to protect the site, and a year later, a
                        more intense exploration were going on by Alain Roussot and Jacques Tixier, finding bone
                        artifacts and small pieces of engravings. The main gallery is the Cap Blanc Frieze where there
                        are excavated multiple animal sculptures, including 14 horses, 13 bisons, 2 reindeers and more
                        dozens of unidentified creatures. This pile of animals were measured to be 13 meters in length.
                        One of the carvings have some colours, like red ochre. The given date to the frieze was 13,000
                        BCE.

                        Its a 10.5cm wide bison figurine which was found in a cave, lies in the Abri de la Madeleine,
                        located under an overhanging cliff and it is on the bank of the Vezere river. The cave is called
                        Madeleine shelter which has yielded thousands of stone tools and artifacts and was initially
                        discovered in 1863 by Edouard Lartet. He planned to make excavations the following year and then
                        later continued under Paul Girod, Denis Peyrony and Louis Capitan. They were finding alot of
                        prehistoric stuff including the Madeleine bison and some engravings. In 1956 the Madeleine rock
                        shelter was classified as a historical monument and then in 1979 it became a UNESCO World
                        Heritage Site. The bison sculpture were dated to the Magdalenian era, over 13,000 BCE and is
                        carved from reindeer antler. Magdalenians are modern humans.

                        Its a cave which is located in county of Les Eyzies, lies in the valley region of southwest
                        France, also known for it's 250 painted and engraved animals, containing horses, reindeers,
                        rhinoceroses, mammoths, bison and a wolf. On 12 September 1901 was the biggest discovery when
                        Denis Peyrony (local schoolmaster), stumbled across multiple painted engravings. I'm saying
                        "biggest", because people have been knowing the cave before the discovery of the paintings, but
                        it was also forgotten in the 19th century due to it's nondiscovery and pure darkness.
                        More of the paintings were discovered in 1966 while scientists were cleaning the cave,
                        discovering the most known painting in that cave today which was the "Bison Frieze", it includes
                        5 bisons, 3 males and 2 females - all with engraved outlines and bodies in brown-black and red,
                        put into a yellow limestone. There are more paintings, given names like "Gallopsing Horse",
                        "Licking Reindeer", "Black Frieze" and "Chapter of the Small Bison". These 3D made animals were
                        done of course, by some skilled artists, but several abstract signs too, including a half
                        circle, 1 oval, 4 hand stencils, 5 tectiforms, 2 quadrangle symbols and 2 H-shaped signs. The
                        drawings were aged close to 14,000 BCE.

           The River Amur forms a border between the region Russian Far East and Northeastern China. Near is a freshwater lake Khummi which is in the Komsomolsky District, lies in Khabarovsk Krai, a part of Russia. The first discoveries were in the 1960s, in the lower Amur River Basin where belongs the sites Khummy and Gasya. Gasya is situated near the Khabarovsk City, and contains many archaeological areas where are discovered pottery that dates back to 12,960 BCE, along with multiple artifacts and stone tools. The found sherds are very similar to Xianrendong pottery, this sandy texture, and decorated with cord-marks on the surfaces. Again, the pots are made with pure hands and fired in bonfires at 450-600 degrees Celsius. Overall the fragments are very similar to Xianrendong fragments as said earlier, and dates back to the Paleolithic era which gives a number of 14,300 BCE. I'm warning you that the picture could wrong source of content because a picture of the fragments was nowhere to be found.

                        discovery was in 1959, when zoologist Alexander Ryumin who is a researcher at the Bashkir state
                        natural reserve, went into the Kapova Cave looking for bats, only stumbling across vivid
                        pictures of animals which were rhinoceros, mammoths, horses, bisons and camels painted with red
                        ochre. The cave itself have 3 levels of wide-scaled halls going for about 3 kilometers, an
                        underground river and lakes, one of them flowing out of the cave which is forming a lake at it's
                        entrance. There are also given specific names to the halls, like one of them is the Hall of
                        Chaos where are painted long-haired horses, a human figure and abstract signs. For summary the
                        cave has over 200 paintings of animals, along with petroglyphs and humanoid figures, most of
                        them painted with ochre mixture of pigments, colors like red and yellow and others made with
                        charcoal. In 2019 there have been more discoveries like spotting several drawings and engravings
                        which wasn't noticed before. The given date was in the 1960s when Otto Bader used carbon-dating
                        and got a number of 12,500 BCE.

                        This painting's location is on the Unghango Clan estate in Balanggarra country which is above of
                        the Drysdale River in the north-eastern Kimberley region of Western Australia. The painting is
                        known for one of the oldest artworks found in Australia. Western Australia Kimberley region has
                        many aboriginal paintings, and a painting of a kangaroo was found in a sandstone rock shelter
                        which is 2 meters in length,
                        painted with red ochre and is known as the "Naturalistic period" which basically features life
                        size animals. Damien Finch used wasp nest technique to date this painting, because in this site,
                        wasps have been building nests for nearly 20,000 years, making nests easy to find. This artwork
                        got a number of 15,300 BCE.

                        Velaa Spila is a pretty large cave which is located on the island of Korcula, in central
                        Dalmation archipelago, overlooking the town of Vela Luka. Its have been mentioned since the 15th
                        century in the Korcula Statute, but it became more popular in 1835 when Nikola Ostoic visited
                        Vela Spilla cave who was a local historian, museum comissioner and antiquity collector. Then in
                        1856 he characterized the cave in modern literature, title of "<i>Compendio Storico Dell Isola
                            Di Curzola</i>". The scientific reseaches started after the World War II, in 1949, an
                        archaeologist Marinko Gjivoje planned to make examinations, therefore in 1951 the excavations
                        began, with the helpers Vinko Foretic, Boris Llakovac and Grga Novak. The excavations were going
                        for a long time before discovering some pot fragments under a 4 metre progression of pleistocene
                        sediments with about 5 levels in 2001 and then later in 2006 more of them were recovered. The
                        oldest one was found on the third level from the bottom and was dated close to 15,500 BCE. The
                        pottery is now on display at the Centre for Culture in Vela Luka. Overall the fragments are
                        about 13,000 - 15,500 BCE. The picture shows one of the bigger fragments there was found.

                        Siega Verde lies in Serranillo, near the Agueda River. Its an archaeological zone which was
                        declared as World Heritage by UNESCO in 2010 and now is an extension of the Valle del Coa
                        archaeological park. This site was found in 1988 by Manuel Santoja and Rosario Perez, they work
                        for the Salamanca archaeological inventory and are prehistoric art teachers. Firstly finding
                        engraved creatures on the open air rocks which are animals like bisons, horses, woolly
                        rhinoceros and reindeers. This site has yielded total of about 500 rock engravings, most of them
                        animals, including 3 human representations and petroglyphs. It is tought that the prehistoric
                        humans chose this place almost as an animal village, because the area was probably highly
                        traversed by animals and then later they decided to decorate the rocks with hundreds of animal
                        engravings. Using the thermoluminescence (TL) method which usually gives the date of prehistoric
                        art, wasn't used here and without it was dated to between 12,000 - 18,000 BCE.

The painted Bradshaw figures are in the Arnhem Land which is near the Northern Territory, north-west region of Western Australia. In 1891, when a guy named Joseph Bradshaw who was a pastoralist, was searching for a suitable pastoral plot near the area river Roe, but then he discovered a mysterious type of paintings on a sandstone escarpment, reporting it to the Royal Geographical Society about the vivid colors and the fine detail these paintings contain. Eventually the American archaeologist Daniel Sutherland Davidson surveyed the rock art, and later in 1936 made some posts of the rock art. This artwork is also called the Gwion Gwion rock paintings where are represented some long-bodied human figures wearing headdresses, dilly bags and tassels, some of them carrying boomerangs and others spears. Its also one of the most mysterious rock art ever found because no one knows who painted these high-detailed, artistic figures. In the 1980s and 90s the Kimberley rock art expert Dr.Grahame L. Walsh decided to make a deep study of the rock art, and eventually believing that the Bradshaws were created by the ancestors of present-day Aboriginal people. Lately were used the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Uranium-Thorium, and Optically Stimulated Luminesence dating methods. A mud wasp's nest was overlaying a Bradsaw picture, and there they got the age using the OSL-dating method, which gave it a number of 15,500 BCE.

The limestone rock shelter is the Yuchanyan Cave, located south of the Yanzi River which is in Daoxian commune, Hunan province in China. Hunan lies south of Lake Dongting, where nearby is the Xianrendong cave. Yuchanyan Cave however, have been noticed by people for many years but there hasn't been seen any evidence of art until the excavations began in the 1980s. The first excavations lasted for 2 years (1993-1995), and the second excavation was in 2004 that lasted for one year, done by teams from the Hunan Provincial Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology. In 2005 the team included Israel, Chinese and American scholars which was led by Elisabetta Boaretto. Between the excavation period the cave has yielded 2cm thick pieces from 2 ceramic vessels, along with shell and bone tools. The pots were made with pure hands, fired at close to 450 degrees Celsius. After a series of tests, the fragments were dated back to 16,000 BCE. Overall the cave was problably occupied by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers.

                        It is a rock shelter located in north of Gachedou, Charente. It's known for the painted
                        limestone blocks, containing around 50 rock engravings, which are animal representations. There
                        are animals like bisons, horses and boars. The art was excavated in 1908 by A.Favraud and then
                        later more of it was found by Dr.Henry Martin in 1917. The engravings were found to between
                        15,000 - 18,000 years old.

Xianrendong Cave is situated at the foot of the Xiaohe mountain which is in the Wannian county in northeast Jianxi region of China, about 100 kilometers south of the Yangtze river. The first excavations were going in the that 7 meters high, 11m wide and 14m deep cave since 1962, and found multiple potsherds along with bone and clamshell tools that dates back to the Neolithic era (4,500 - 10,000 BCE). In 2012 were reported some findings in the <i>Science</i> journal, when the oldest known pottery was found near the same cave, dating back to 19,000 years. The Xianrendong site has overall yielded 282 pottery sherds that are 0.7 - 1.2 cm in thick, with other artifacts, like stone tools and animal bones. The pots were about 20 cm in diameter and poorly fired. Probably used for cooking because many of the pots had scorch marks. It is suggested that the ceramics were used by the hunder-gatherers in East Asia, they placed seasonal camps to make pottery for food. Overall it makes the oldest found ceramics in the world.

                        The cave is located in the commune of Villhonneur that is in the Charante department. The Le Placard Cave which is in a cliff, overlooking the River Tardoire was first discovered in 1853, and there on the cave has been investigated many times. The first exploration was done by JL Fermond in 1864, and after him was the Placard landowner A. de Maret, who conducted some excavations and eventually finding some artifacts that were damaged by he himself. When he found the artifacts, he did not care about the damage he did to the findings, tought to make a profit by digging out the top-quality artifacts, but luckily the cave still contained more artwork, because in 1987 Louis Duport did another excavation that would bring him some rock engravings. Later in 1988 he reported his findings, and there on a new series of excavations of the new galleries began in 1990, that lasted for 5 years. The latest investigations proved that the rock shelter had been decorated with engravings, including paintings. The engravings along with the paintings have been dated back to 17,500 - 17,970 BCE. The main animals are horses, but also including unfinished ibexes, unidentified figures, a single deer and several abstract signs.

                        Koonalda is a cave which is 70 meters below the flat. The cave has multiple entrances and it
                        includes alot of Paleolithic art. It is located inside Nullarbor National Park. The cave was
                        mainly used for flint mine. The artwork was discovered by archaeologists in 1956, 70 meters
                        under the Nullarbor Plain were found aboriginal finger-flutings in the soft limestone walls and
                        was said that the art is about 18,000 BCE. However in Decemember 2022, people reported that some
                        of the artwork was destroyed by vandals, they gained an illegal access to the cave since June
                        2022. So in March 2023 the Australian government installed more cameras, overall more security.

                        La Pileta Cave was found in the early 20th century by a local farm family hunting bat guano. Now
                        this cave is open for everyone. The cave system was originally an underground river. Some
                        periods were dry and stalactities formed, while the wetter periods the system flowed with
                        torrents of water. The cave includes paintings of animals and signs that we don't understand.
                        The floor was excavated, also discovered more stuff like pottery and some animal bones. The art
                        was found to be 18,130 BCE by taking some tests. There are alot of methods, how archaeologists
                        age these old artworks. Most known is the Uranium decay method.

                        This cave painting was discovered by four teenagers, they had a dog with them that stumbled upon
                        a cave entrance and led to a cavern. The cave included 15,000 - 21,000 year old paintings which
                        were animal representations. The art is from the Upper Paleolithic period and was found in
                        France, Near Montignac. The walls are decorated with over 600 animal paintings, mainly horses.
                        The cave's name is Lascaux grotto and it was opened to the public in 1948 and was closed in
                        1963, because the artificial lights faded the bright colors. They made a replica and was opened
                        again in 1983.

The Buret is an archaeological site that is situated near the village of Buret, on the right bank of the Angara, in the Bokhansky division which is about 120 km northwest of Irkutsk. This site in Russia was discovered in 1936 by Alexei Pavlovich Okladnikov who was a Siberian archaeologist. In the same year he started excavations with Vera Zaporozhskaya. Over the 4 year excavation, they had found 5 little sculptures where all them were in 3 seperate residentals. One of the dwellings was set in it's semi-underground pit, but overall these organized along the river terrace, that overlooked the river. The Figurine 1 was found in 1936, carved out of mammoth ivory, Figurine 2 was discovered in 1939, in dwelling 4, and the other 3 venuses were found in dwelling number 2. Buret is also close to Mal'ta where the Mal'ta venuses were discovered years earlier. For summary it makes these figurines one of the oldest discoveries in Siberia and are dated back to the final period of Gravettian culture, 20,000 BCE.

                        The Coa Valley is main area of prehistoric art in Portugal. It is the largest open air site of
                        Paleolithic art in the world. It has lots of open air rock engravings of animals and human
                        figures, dating back to about 22,000 BCE, it makes the oldest art found in Portugal. Rare sight
                        is that the engravings weren't made inside. There are total of 23 archaelogical sites in the
                        lower Coast River Valley. The engravings were discovered in the early 1990s By Nelson Rebanda
                        and found there about 5,000 engraved drawings of lots of different animals (horses, bisons) and
                        abstract signs. The open air rock art is about 30,000 BCE.

                        village of Lespugue in Haute-Garonne near the Pyreness was a cave of Les Rideaux. It was this
                        single figurine that was found in that cave and is about 15 centimeters tall. The figurine

                        Abri du Poisson is know for it's salmon rock shelter, dating back to 23,000 BCE. Fishes are
                        rarely illustrated in parietal art of the Gravettian. This shelter lies in the valley of the
                        Gorge d'Enfer. The cave is only 8 meters wide and 7 meters deep. Cave discovery was in 1892 by
                        Paul Girod, but the fish was found by Jean Marsan in 1912 and the following year it made
                        Historic Monument and was later excavated by Denis Peyrony, he succedeeded dismantling the stone
                        carving of the salmon which is about a whole metre long. Also near the fish were remains of a
                        bison image which is still visible today. The third art was spotted in 1975 which was a outlined
                        hand, used unknown painting tools.

                        Venus of Brassempouy was found during an archaeological investigation of two local Brassempouy
                        caves which are known as the Galerie des Hyenes and Grotte du Pape. Some time later after the
                        discovery, the figurine was named "Lady with the Hood", there was only found some tools and
                        ivory carvings. The carving is 3.5cm in height and 1.9cm wide. This figurine is known for the
                        first realistic representation that shows a human face, but the mouth is missing, because it
                        might wasn't finished, but at the same time the figurine had a body, which possibly was
                        destroyed during Antiquity. It is approximately 23,000 BCE.

                        It was discovered in 1911 by J.G.Lalanne, in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. Venus
                        of Laussel is a large free-standing block of limestone which originally was decorated with color
                        pigments made from red ochre and its about 44.5 centimeters in height. It shows a form of
                        fertility symbolism. The horn which is in her hands may refer the 13 months of the lunar year
                        and associated with fertility. The stone carving is about 23,000 BCE.

                        There are two caves about 200 meters apart, one is known for its Paleolithic art and the other
                        noted for its mass of stalactites and stalagmites. They are located in the commune of Payrignac,
                        near Lot region of southwest France. Both caves were discovered in 1952 by Lucien Gouloumes,
                        Jean Mazet, Rene Borne and Maurice Alphonse Sauvant. These caves included finger marketings
                        which were about 12,000 BCE, some signs we cannot understand. There are hallways that contain
                        more signs, one of the hallways has six bird-like aviform signs and on some walls are painted
                        some animals with red ochre.

                        This figurine was discovered in Slovakia and was unearthed in 1938 by Stefan Hulman-Petrech. It
                        was sent for examination to Abbe Breuil, in Paris. It was judged to be a Paleolithic statue,
                        many years went by and was returned to Slovakia in 1967. The figurine is about 7 centimeters in
                        height and made out of mammoth tusk ivory. Its another example of Stone Age art and is dated
                        back to 22,000 - 24,000 BCE. Several copies have been made and they are displayed at the Vienna
                        Natural History Museum. Oh and also it's unknown where was it exactly found.

                        Its situated near Yonne division in Burgundy, France. The site which is in south-faced limestone
                        cliff, facing the Cure river, is known for it's multiple caves having unusual cave paintings. In
                        1990, a French TV crew launched a program where they talked about Arcy-sur-Cure grotto on it's
                        geology, while some of them spotting a painting of an ibex. In the 2000s there has been
                        discovered about 70 animal paintings and abstract signs on the ceiling and walls of the cave.
                        Dominique Baffier from the Centre Nationel de la Recerche Scientifique said that almost all the
                        cave paintings were destroyed by a man who privately held this cave. In 1976, the private holder
                        of the cave who tought to remove years of soot from visitors using the chlorhydric acid, made a
                        huge mistake, taking down somewhere 80% of the cave paintings. Some of the cave paintings,
                        giving a date of 27,000 BCE, still look pretty vivid as if someone painted them hours ago.
                        The cave has 282 paintings and still counting, because every year people discovering more of
                        them in that cave. There are also several handprints made by adult and children. 70% of the
                        paintings are represented dangerous animals like rhinoceros, lions, bears and mammoths which
                        this this picture shows.

                        Roucadour Cave lies in the region of Quercy, France, near town of Themines. It was first
                        discovered in 1860 by EA Martel, but the first excavations were in the 1950s. The cave art was
                        spotted in 1962 october by local speleologists Jean-Paul Coussy and P.Taurisson. In 1963 the
                        site was visited by Abbe Andre Glory who spent three years surveying the cave's engravings and
                        then on july 29, 1966 he mysteriously disappeared along with his assistant Father Jean-Louis
                        Villeveygoux. Between 1966 - 2002 the cave was closed to full archaeological exploration. Its
                        examined by lots of historians and archaeologists. Roucadour cave includes about 150 engravings
                        of animal figures, almost half of them are horses, others deers, bisons, woolly mammoths, ibexes
                        and birds. It also has signs what we don't understand yet which are 600 vertical lines and 30
                        circles. Lastly there are 12 handprints, in red ochre and carbon-black, dating back to about
                        24,000 BCE.

                        Venus of Savignano is known for the oldest stone art found in Italy. It was discovered in 1925
                        by Mr.Olindo Zambelli. The figurine was buried 4-feet deep in clay soil, which was at Savignano
                        sul Punaro, near Modena. It was given to Professor Giuseppe Graziosi who donated it to the
                        Pigorini Museum in Rome. When it was found, there were no traces of any ancient cave art. So
                        giving the date to the figurine was impossible, but some suggested around 24,000 BCE. It is
                        about 22 centimeters in height and 4.8 centimeters in width.

                        Gargas cave is known for it's 200 hand stencil collection and nearly 150 rock engravings of
                        animals. It is located at the edge of the Haute-Garonne, near Montrejeau in France. Some of the
                        cave parts have been known since the 16th-century, but the two main chambers were
                        archaeologically explored at the end of the 19th-century by several scholars - containing Abbe
                        Henri Breuil and Emile Cartailhac. In 1906 the art was discovered by Felix Regnault, he is a
                        local scholar. The cave art is dated back to 25,000 BCE. As I mentioned before the cave includes
                        dozens of handprints covered in red ochre and carbon black and lots of animal engravings. For
                        summary the cave has more than 500 meters of galleries on two levels, the lower level is much
                        bigger. Both levels were unconnected until the rockfall which was in during the Middle Ages.

                        It contains some of the finest examples of prehistoric art. It is known as "The Spotted Horses
                        of Pech-Merle" which is along with numerous hand stencils, it also has aviform or placard-type
                        signs, one is known as the "Wounded Man", which shows a man wounded by several spears, painted
                        in red ochre. The painted chambers which are in lower level of the cave were spotted in 1922 by
                        teenagers Andre David and Henri Dutertre and were examined by Father Amedee Lemozi. But the
                        cave's famous gallery wasn't discovered until 1949. A passage was cleared through the rubble
                        blocking it and was found more Paleolithic art, including about 300 meters of galleries, tools,
                        food remains and prehistoric footprints. For summary it has total of about 570 seperate
                        paintings where only 60 are animal representations and the art is about 25.000 BCE. The cave was
                        opened to the public in 1926 and is still avaible to all of us.

                        Cussac Cave or Grotte de Cussac is known for it's outstanding rock engravings, dating back to
                        approximately 25,000 BCE, it has 150 works of Paleolithic art where most are engraved drawings.
                        It is located in the Dordogne River valley, in Aquitaine, France, and was originally discovered
                        in 1950 by the scholar Denis Peyrony, but he couldn't get further, becacuse of the rockfall near
                        the entrance. The cave was rediscovered in September 2000, by the amateur speleologist Marc
                        Delluc who worked his way trough the rockfall and almost immediately found some cave art. Later
                        some cave explorers came from Periguex, named Herve Durif and Fabrice Massouiler. In May 2001,
                        archaeologists arrived from France's National Centre for Prehistory, they examinated and
                        excavated the cave interior. There is the main chamber called "Grand Panel" and is basically
                        accessed at entrance area where is 10-metre-long passageway. When you trough, then there is a
                        large room about 13 meters wide and 12 meters high, including a lot of stalagmites. This area
                        contains about 20 images of prehistoric animals (horses and bisons) which are about 4 meters in
                        width (This picture shows).

                        This cave is located in limestone hills around the Calanque de Morgiou. The cave lies about 120
                        feet underwater. It was discovered in 1985, by the deep-sea diver Henri Cosquer, returning to
                        surface several times before finding some hand stenchils, petroglyphs and pictographs on the
                        cave's walls. archaeologists were noted of the art discovery in 1991, they also performed
                        several investigations before the cave complex was assigned to the French Ministry of Culture.
                        The cave contains 65 hand stencils, 177 engraved and painted animals which around 30% are
                        horses, one bison, aurochs, ibexes, chamnois, fishes(they are pretty rare in cave paintings),
                        220 geometric signs and 10 unspecified markings.

Dolní Věstonice is another archaeological site located near the village Dolní Věstonice, this village lies in the Břeclav division which is south of the reservoir Nové Mlýny, that lies in the Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. The first excavations were in 1924, where the site has yielded numerous ceramic artifacts that dates back to the Gravettian era. This 4.8cm in height portrait head was discovered there nearby buried, its a elongated portrait of a Shaman, carved out of mammoth ivory and appears to wear her hair pulled up tightly to a bun. The woman was buried underneath 2 mammoth scapulas, she was a 40 year old woman who possibly made this figurine. The mammoth bones included some red ochre, sprinkled with soil, and a fox belt along with a flint fragments was placed next to the skull, meaning that she was a Shaman (modern human). This figurine was dated back to 25,000 BCE.

                        Venus of Willendorf is one the most famous items of prehistoric sculpture, it was carved out of
                        oolitic limestone. Discovery was on August 7, 1908 by Austrian archaeologist Josef Szombathy in
                        Austra, near Krems. This figurine stands 11,1cm in height (4.4 inches), painted with red ochre
                        and estimated about 25,000 - 30,000 years ago. It is widely believed that this figurine
                        represents early fertility deity, mother goddess. It never had legs and maybe was pegged into
                        soft ground.

                        This figurine was discovered in a ploughed field by Monsieur Elisee Cerou in april 1970 and were
                        also found some stone tools nearby, but no cave art at all. Little bit later when he found the
                        statue, it almost collapsed to pieces, head and one foot came off, it was obviously driven over
                        by some machines on the field. Venus of Monpazier was later reconstructed, luckily using many
                        taken photographs of the figurine. Its a 5.6 centimetre tall, 1.6cm width and 1.4cm thick statue
                        and is carved out of a local abundant rock including mostly limontie with added quartz and clay,
                        main color is brown, but there can be seen yellow spots behind the legs.

The Balzi Rossi rock shelters are also known as the Grimaldi Caves where they lay on the Mediterranean shore, the shore is right on the French-Italian border, on the side near the town of Ventimiglia, Italy. Its a large Grimaldi cave complex that contains 8 caves, named L'Abri Lorenzi, L'Abri Mochi, Grotta del Caviglione, Barma Grande, Grotte des Enfants, the Grotte du Prince and Barma di Baousso de Torre which is now collapsed. Nearby the caves lies smaller rock shelters, located around the caves. These caves have been noticed already in the 1870s where Émile Riviére decided to do some excavations that lasted for 5 years, from 1870 to 1875, but finding nothing. Then came an antiques dealer Louis Alexander Jullien, he was also an amateur archaeologist from Marseilles, he conducted a bigger excavation that lasted from 1883 to 1895, and he was the one who found the cave complex's portable artworks. In the 20th century due to Prince Albert I, the cave complex was renamed the "Caves of Grimavladi" in his honour. Jullien had found a total of 13 different-shaped figurines and the names are - "Venus Abrachiale", "Nun Venus", "Woman with Goitre", "Bust", "Woman with Perforated Neck", "Venus of Menton", "Venus el Rombo", "Red Ochre Venus", "Venus of Polichinelle", "Double Venus", "Two-Header Woman", "Hermaphrodite Venus" and "Undescribed Venus". All of their ages could be different, but the avarage number of the figurines is 25,000 BCE.

                        The Apoll 11 Cave is located near Great Fish Rivers, its a archaelogical site in the Karas
                        Region of south-western Namibia. The cave contains one of the oldest art found in Africa. The
                        oldest ones dates back to 25,500 BCE which were 7 grey-brown quartzite slabs excavated from the
                        cave. There were also found several red and white paintings, simple geometric patterns. The
                        oldest art was a rock which was in 2 pieces (this picture shows), both were buried in domestic
                        debris. As I said earlier there were discovered 7 slabs, on them are some painted animals,
                        (rhinoceroses and zebras), probably used charcoal and use of red ochre. Some 150 meters from the
                        cave entrance were also some stone drawings, made by Kloekhoe settlers, contain of animal
                        representations and abstract signs. The art were excavated in 1969.

                        This statue was found in 2 pieces in July 1925. It was buried in a layer of ash at paleolithic
                        encampment in Moravia, a region in Czechoslovakia. The archaeological investigation lasted for
                        about a whole year by Karel Absolon. Eventually massive diggings unearthed alot of ceramic art
                        dating back to Paleolithic culture and including more than 700 animal figurines, fired in kilns
                        at Dolni Vestonice. In 1986, skeletons of a young man and woman were marked by ritualistic
                        injuries, they were excavated from a shallow burial pit (at Dolni Vestonice). The figurine
                        measures 4.4 inches in height and 1.7 inches in width, (11cm x 4cm), the Venus of Dolni
                        Vestonice is made from local clay, mixed with bone dust and fired in an earthen oven at a fairly
                        low temperature about 1300 F (700C). There are also 4 holes in her head (which you can't see on
                        the picture), but possibly where you can put flowers or herbs. In 2004 was found a fingerprint
                        on the figurine, a 7-15 year old child who possibly wasn't involved in the ceramicist. The year
                        of the figurine is about 26,000 BCE.

                        shelter was rediscovered by Ray Whear and Chris Morgan of the Jawoyn Association while flying by
                        helicopter on 15 June 2006. In May 2010, before archaeologists began their excavation, Robert
                        Gunn conducted an extensive examination of it's parietal art, which includes abstract signs,
                        multi-colour paintings and rock engravings. The big discovery was on October, 2011, at the USQ
                        archaeology laboratory, while analyzing material excavated from a small square of the Gabarnmang
                        shelter, Professor Barker a black drawing on the underside of a granite piece, which had fallen
                        from the ceiling. The drawing was made charcoal, therefore it was sent for analysis to the
                        laboratory of New Zealand's University of Waikato, and was said that its about 26,000 BCE. This
                        drawing is a 3cm by 3cm rock, which show 2 crossed lines, one is straight and other slightly
                        curved. This picture shows Aboriginal mural paintings which are in wall and ceilings, its the
                        main place that has about 1500 square meters of living space.

                        This cave named Grotte des Deux-Ouvertures is located at the end of the Ardeche River Gorge,
                        downstream from Chauvet, the point where the river reaches open country. Firstly it was occupied
                        by bears and then Neanderthal hunter-gatherers. This cave measures 140 meters in length and has
                        multiple chambers, including Bears Gallery, Torch Marks Hall and Claw Marks Chamber. The
                        galleries were discovered on December 23rd, in 1985 by C.Hillaire, M.Verdon and F.Montel. For
                        summary the cave is known for it's petroglyphs of animals, images of horses, mammoths, aurochs,
                        bisons and a male Alpine ibex with massive horns. There are also some abstract signs, triangular
                        shapes and red spots. The animals engravings are about 26,500 BCE.

                        This statue was discoverd on September 23, 1988 during the first excavation of an Aurignacian
                        shelter, used by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers at Galgenberg which is near Stratzing, Australia.
                        Flint tools and some other stone tools were found, but no cave art. When they found the
                        figurine, it was lying in pieces, completely broken. A huge number of tiny fragments of
                        serpentine were found near the statue and that tells us that it was carved locally. Its a 7.2cm
                        tall (3 inches) figurine which weights 10 grams, the upper body is turned to one side, it's in
                        dancing position. The statue were found to be 26,000 BCE.

                        Ubirr Rock is a famous site of Aboriginal rock art, it is on the edge of the Nadab floodplain.
                        Known as Obiri Rock is the most popular site in Kakadu National Park, Arnhem Land, in
                        Australia's Norhtern Territory. It is believed that the art dates back to 30,000 BCE, but the
                        most noted one is 28,000 BCE. There are alot of vivid colors used in these cave paintings,
                        aborigine artits painted mainly huge images, representing human figures and animals. The
                        principal gallery is the most photographed and contains many examples of X-ray art. This picture
                        shows a painted fish which dates back to 28,000 BCE. The site discovery year is unknown.

                        Its located in the Pillbara area of Western Australia, near Dampier Archipelago. The Burrup
                        Peinsula is also know as "Murujuga", meaning "Hip bone sticking out". This is the world's
                        biggest rock art site with over 1 million rock engravings. Dating is almost impossible, but
                        people have mentioned that it is 30,000 BCE, but still unconfirmed. This site is mostly known
                        for it's petroglyphs. The most noticeable thing is animals, but also human representations. The
                        site has different igneous rocks which are one of the strongest types in Australia, like
                        dolerite, granodiorite, rhyodacite and more. The art was made by Ngarluma, Yaburara,
                        Yindjibarndi, Mardudhunera people.

                        The cave was first discovered in the 19th century, but whoever the man was, he didn't really go
                        deep into the cave, it wasn't until in 1981, the archaeologist Gabor Halasi decided to go
                        investigate the cave, but he did not find any cave art, there was also a place which was flooded
                        and he didn't have any diving equipment. In September, 2009 was the big discovery. A large group
                        of people went to the cave with diving equipment, including Mihai Besesek, Tudor Rus, Valentin
                        Alexandru Radu, Roxana Laura Toiciu and Marius Kenesz. While exploring the underwater part, they
                        spotted the cave art. No public statement was made until May 2010, when a French team of
                        specialists arrived, including another team of speleologists, where was Marcel Meyssonnier and
                        Valerie Plichon. Lastly alot of paleontologists came aswell to analyze the paintings. Multiple
                        samples were taken to Paris for further examination and dating. Were said that the paintings are
                        about 21,000 - 30,000 BCE. The cave contains around 8 images drawn with black charcoal pieces.
                        Commonly cave art represents animals, which this cave does too, it has a bison, 2 bear heads, a
                        horse, head of a black rhino, two rhinos and feline creature. One bad thing is that the cave
                        drawings have been eroded by the cave bats. Later there was found more art, one was engraving of
                        a female torso and the other one hasn't been identified.

Situated in the parish of the small town Ribadesella which is in the Prinicpality of Asturias, northwest Spain. Sitting in a limestone rock, this cave with it's art was discovered in the Spring of 1968, by a leader Celestino Fernandez Bustillo and his group of potholers who were from the Torreblanca Spelelogy Society. Later examinations and excavations of the cave and it's rock art were done by Alfonso Moure Romanillo, Jose Javier Alcolea and Rodrigo de Balbin Behrmann. The found stone tools, artifacts and fossils were dated back to 14,000 BCE, but the cave in total has many different paintings and rock engravings. This cave overall contains red paintings, charcoal drawings, some of the drawings mixed with black, violet ochre pigments, petroglyphs and signs that we cannot understand, at least yet. The animals are horses, reindeers, aurochs, bisons and ibexes. The eastern part shows really well a group of animals. The main galleries are - Gallery of Horses, Gallery of the Anthromorphs, The Cavern of la Lloseta and Chamber of Vulvas. Some people firstly tought that the paintings are about 15,000 BCE, but the Uranium-thorium dating method delivered the answer. It got a number of 36,000 years (34,000 BCE).

                        The art was discovered in 1994, at Ardeche gorge by 3 speleologists - Jean-Marie Chauvet,
                        Eliette Brunel-Deschamps and Christian Hillaire. They were surveying a second cave nearby and
                        inside the Chauvet grotto, they found a 400-metre long network of galleries and rooms, which
                        were covered in rock art and petroglyphs. On the floor were also found skulls of bears and
                        wolves. The cave contains footprints of animals, again alot of animals and humans. The paintings
                        look pretty honestly, because <i>Homo sapiens</i> learnt to draw pretty well at a very early
                        stage. The painted animals is unusual tho, because commonly in cave paintings, there are showed
                        animals as food, but in Chauvet Cave animals are like warriors, they are in teams and about to
                        fight eachother, the dangerous animals. The picture shows the painted animals with black
                        charcoal, which was made by a single master artist and is dated back to 30,000 BCE.

                        Swabian Jura lies in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. There are actually alot of caves and
                        rock shelters, where nearby have been also found the Hohldenstein-Stadel and Hohle Fels. In
                        2008, on September 5-15, near the town of Schelklingen, excavators recovered six fragments of
                        carved ivory. On september 9, the main piece of the sculpture that shows the majority of the
                        torso was found while excavating. The figurine was lying almost 3 meters below the current
                        surface of the cave in an area about 20 meters from the cave's entrance. All the finding came
                        from a single quartermeter. Original color was red-brown and it was carved out of mammoth ivory.
                        Its one of the oldest discovered carvings in the world currently which is between 31,000 -
                        40,000 BCE.

                        The cave itself was first discovered in 1868 by Modesto Peres, while searching for his dog, he
                        was a local hunter, but in 1879 was the real discovery, when Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola, local
                        nobleman and archaeologist was excavating the cave's floor for artifacts and then spotted some
                        murals on the ceiling. Later Marcelino examined the cave further along with Juan Vilanova y
                        Piera, he is an archaeologist from the University of Madrid. Then in 1880 the two made a report
                        that the cave's engravings and wall paintings are from the Paleolithic era, prehistory.
                        Eventually some experts red report and they tought that the founding is not possible or
                        ridicule, in Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon, but finally in 1902 they admitted their mistake
                        and acknowledged the authenticity of the Altamira paintings. In the 1950s, anthropologist Henri
                        Breuil began sharing copies of the paintings and the site gained it's fame. In 2008, British
                        scientists dated the paintings using the Uranium method. They found specific artworks to be
                        between 23,000 - 33,000 BCE, they just kept examining the place, so in 2012, a club-shaped image
                        was dated to be 34,000 BCE using the U/Th tests. The Uranium test always gives the minimum age,
                        so the artwork could be even older.

                        The Fumane Cave is near the north-eastern city of Verona and its the home to the oldest Stone
                        Age art in Italy. In 1988, a huge number of figurative cave paintings on fragments of rock were
                        found by archaeologists. The cave painting contains animals and a half-human and animal figure
                        covered in red ochre. The art is dated back to 35,000 BCE. The first discovery of the cave was
                        in 1964 by Giovanni Solinas and an immediate examination was conducted by Natural History Museum
                        of Verona. They did not do any excavations which led them to finding nothing. Finally in 1988
                        the art was found tho. The cave's art is pictures painted in red ochre on pieces of a rock which
                        is from the cave wall. It was found buried under layers of debris. It's a whole image that
                        contains plenty of images, an animal with an elongated neck - might be a weasel, a figure of a
                        man and a weird creature that has 5 legs. There nearby were also found some abstract signs,
                        which were dots made with red and yellow ochre.

                        Abri Castanet is an archaeological site in the Vezere valley in the Dordogne region of
                        southwestern France. It was first excavated in the 1900s, but nothing were found. In 2007,
                        archaeologists were reviewing part of the collapsed roof of the Abri Castanet rock shelter,
                        which is in the Dordogne. While excavating they paid their attention to a large slab, which had
                        fallen from the cave roof to floor. They were cutting the stone block into pieces in order to
                        remove them from the cave, and then they spotted some petroglyphs under the slab. There was one
                        circular engraving, believed to represent a female genitalia, and there was multiple paintings
                        covered in red ochre. By taking 6 molecular filtration tests on the animal bones which also were
                        found on the cave floor, it dates back to 35,000 BCE, the oldest found art in France.

                        Baume-Latrone is a cave which is located in the region of Occitaine, Gard department of Southern
                        France. The paintings of the cave were discovered in 1940 by A.Glory and P.Fitte. They
                        immediately began examining the place, finding out that the cave has suffered from acts of
                        vandalism and human presence. Gard department has actually 5 caves, which one of them is this
                        cave and all of them show animal representations.
                        The main cave (Baume-Latrone), have a ceiling that has a large feline, which is about 3m in
                        size, surrounded by 8 mammoths and an animal which have been tought to be a horse, but after
                        comparisons with the strategy, how artists painted ears on rhinoceroses in the Aldene and
                        Chauvet caves, showed that its a rhinoceros. The cave has total of more than 30 images,
                        including more animals like a bear, 2 ibexes, 2 deers, 2 aurochs, but also 6 handprints, finger
                        flutings and engraved drawings of animal figurines. This site with the drawings were dated to be
                        between 30,000-40,000 BCE and has been classified as a prehistoric monument ever since May 10,
                        1941.

                        That cave is known for it's Neanderthal occupation and 8 small rock engravings. Gorham's Cave is
                        located on the east side of Gibraltar which is some meters above the sea level. The cave has a
                        big entrance, about 35 m (115ft) high and is approximately 100m in length (330ft). This cave is
                        named after army Captain A. Gorham who first discovered it in 1907. There are some stone tools
                        recovered from the cave and taken geological survey of the site in 1945 by Lietenant George
                        Baker Alexander and then afterwards several excavations were done on the cave by Dr. John d'Arcy
                        Waechter and Professor Dorothy Garrod. The researchers returned to the cave in the 1980s, but no
                        cave art, so it had to happen. In 2012 the cave art was spotted by Francisco Giles Pacheco, it
                        was 100 meters from the cave entrance, engraved onto table-shaped surface. At PACEA Laboratory
                        were taken a series of microscopic tests, and the tests showed that the marketings were done by
                        human hand. Possibly a Neanderthal was on top of the rock, cutting animals skins. The cave floor
                        has a large criss-cross sign (20x15cm), which was deeply scratched with obviously stone tools.
                        For summary people believe that a Neanderthal used this cave for living, because of the found
                        stone tools. The given date was between 37,000 - 39,000 BCE, which was the abstract sign.

                        The Altxerri cave is in county of Aya, the hillside of Monte Beobategana. This cave is known for
                        one of the oldest Paleolithic art sites in Europe and also it's size, which is about 2
                        kilometers in length. It was firstly discovered in 1956, while digging, a hole appeared which
                        led into a huge cave, but no one attempted to explore the connecting shafts until October 1962
                        when 3 guys named F.Aranzadi, J.C.Vicuna and J.Migliaccio from the Aranzadi Science Society at
                        San Sebastian decided to investigate the panels of the cave, discovering extremely old art and
                        reporting it to Jose Miguel de Barandiaran who is the director of the Society's Prehistory
                        Department. In 1964, he properly explored the cave, publishing his own findings. There on
                        Altxerry cave has been examined by archaeologists, including Dr Aitor Ruiz-Redondo. Its been
                        confirmed that the cave art is from the Aurignacian era and is approximately 37,000 BC. The cave
                        has been manufactured in 2 areas which one of them is upper level, (known as Altxerri B), and
                        the other level is the lower level. The main gallery is on the lower level, about 100 meters
                        from the entrance. There are over 140 images in total, where 120 of them are engraved. Animals
                        in cave art are pretty common, this cave having 92 images of animals, containing bisons,
                        reindeers, deers, ibexes, horses, aurochs, antelopes, a hare, a fox, one wolverine, a bird and
                        one snake. The picture shows one of the animals which is the fox.

                        This tiny figurine was discovered in Hohle Fels, its a German cave which is near Schelklingen.
                        The discovery was in September 2008, which was found by the University of Tübingen
                        archaeologists, the statue was pretty broken, atleast in 6 pieces and was lying in the cave
                        hall, 20m from the entrance and 3m from the ground level, but still the left arm is missing. In
                        2015 were found that its about 35,000 - 40,000 BCE and sculpted from woolly mammoth tusk. Some
                        say that it was meant to be an amulet, due to it's size and it has a preforated protrusion.

                        East Kalimantan caves are located in the interior of mountains of East Kalimantan, which are on
                        Borneo island in Indonesia. In 1998, when French and Indonesian archaeologists explored the
                        decorated cavities in the thick forested peaks of the Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Peninsula,
                        finding some murals. First it was tought that the paintings are only 10,000 years old, but later
                        using the Uranium-thorium method, these paintings were dated to be around 30,000 BCE. There have
                        been found art like black hand stencils, some of them are painted with red ochre, then a huge
                        image of a wild cow, which is painted in orange-reddish ochre pigments, about 2 meters in length
                        and the determined age was 37,400 BCE, finally the oldest hand stencil, minimum dating of
                        21,000-50,000 BCE. Some of the handstencils were painted with dots and lines. The most
                        mysterious thing is that no traces of human occupation was found in the painted caves.

                        The pieces of the sculpture discovered on 25 August 1939 by Otto Völzing, it was in Stadel-Hohle
                        cave, in the Valley of the Swabian Alps. The World War II had been already started so the
                        figurine's fragments were quickly taken to Museum Ulm and just lied there for about 30 years. So
                        in 1969, when the fragments were rediscovered by Professor Joachim Hahn from the University of
                        Tübingen, he took the pieces to the Landesmuseum Württemberg workshops. Then the restoration
                        began, the restorers were Ute Wolf and Schmid. The proccess was harder than they tought, because
                        it was in about 200 fragments and the figurine's head was still missing, but between 1997 -
                        1998, the head was found and eventually the ivory carving was fully assembled. Firstly while
                        they were reassembling the statue, tought that the figurine shows represents a male, but later
                        including the head, the final result was female. Its known for it's nickname, which is "Lion
                        Human", (Löwenmensch) and also it's size, much bigger than the other venuses. Its a 31.1cm tall
                        figurine, carved from mammoth ivory by using simple flint-cutting tool. It is tought that the
                        statue represents a shaman with a lion mask. Also the statue wasn't done, because in 2008,
                        excavations were going in the Hohle Stadel Cave, finding even more pieces of the sculpture. They
                        really didn't wanna reassemble the figurine again due to the hard work, so the found pieces were
                        just added to the figurine, but the work was still difficult and was completed in late 2013. It
                        had grew from height 29,6 to 31.1 centimeters. The fragments of the figurine were laying 30
                        meters to the cave, including bone tools and worked antlers. The cave itself was possibly a
                        hiding place and used as storehouse. The Löwenmensch statue was found to be between 35,000 -
                        41,000 BCE.

                        Sulawesi is a place, located in the south of Indonesia, which has multiple caves in the
                        Maros-Pangkep. The caves are named like Saripa, Jane, Pettae, Jarie, Karrasa and more, every
                        cave there has a unique name. The very first cave visitors were Alfred Wallace and a British
                        explorer in July 1857, during Alfred's trip to East Indies, but they didn't mention the cave art
                        for some reason, it wasn't until the 1950s when a Dutch scholar made multiple reports of several
                        animals images and hand stencils, he was an archaeologist named H.R. van Heereken. Tought by
                        several people that the cave art wasn't older than 12,000 years, but recently an Australian and
                        Indonesian team of archaeologists and researchers, including Adan Brumm and Maxime Aubert,
                        examined 12 images of human hands and 2 animal representations. Most of the artwork were found
                        to be around 25,000 years old by taking Uranium tests, (Uranium decay technique), which gives
                        the minimum age. That's not it, in Leang Timpsuseng Cave, which is in Sulawesi, on 4-metre high
                        ceiling, a black hand stencil was found and the given date was 37,000 - 38,000 BCE. This picture
                        shows one of the caves which has 8 hand stencils and a pig-deer, known as babirusas.

                        El Castillo Cave is located in the town of Puente Viesgo, Spain. This cave's art was discovered
                        in 1903 by the Spanish archeaologist Hermilio Alcalde del Rio. The cave's lenght is about 300
                        meters and has a gallery of 100 images and several rock engravings. There are drawings of
                        horses, mammoths, a deer, one bison and the rarest ones - dogs. They have been dated back to
                        15,000 - 20,000 BCE, but aren't as old as the dots painted in red ochre called "red disks". This
                        picture shows the hand stencils covered in red ochre, which are fount to be 37,300 BCE, but the
                        red disks are about 39,000 BCE. This cave tells us that Neanderthals were might be the first
                        painters in the world.

                        Divje Babe is an archaeological park, situated 230 meters above the valley of the Idrijca River.
                        The flute was found in 1995 during regular archaelogical excavation, it was under a layer of
                        sediments, (layer 8), along other stone tools which Neanderthals used. I'm saying layer 8,
                        because the excavations determined 26 sediment layers. Using the electron spin resonance method,
                        the flute was dated to between 48,000-58,000 BCE. Its an 11-centimetre tall flute, that have
                        been tought that the holes were made a animal, simple chewing on the bone. For addition, the
                        cave has been provided more than 600 archaelogical units from about 10 levels and Divje Babe
                        means "Witch Cave".

                        La Ferrassie is an archaeological site in the Dordogne department, lies in Savignac-de-Miremont,
                        France. The site was first visited by M. Tabanou in 1896, he was a teacher who died of a
                        landslide, it was in Badegoule rock shelter. So in 1905, Denis Peyrony and Louis Capitan
                        reexplored the site, finding signs of human occupation, which were probably Neanderthals and
                        some stone tools. In 1909 a Neanderthal child skeleton was lying under a limestone slab, found
                        by Denis. This site is only known for it's petroglyphs, but multiple skeleton and bone findings,
                        which means there was ritualistic activity. When he found the child's skeleton, under the child
                        was cupule art, it had 2 large hollows and 8 pairs of small holes. For summary the rock shelter
                        has several rock engravings and paintings of animal figurines. The cupules on the rock were to
                        be about 60,000 BCE and all these discovered skeletons and bones were Neanderthals. This picture
                        shows a few female vulvas done deeply in the rock.

                        About 270 fragments, stone tools and artifacts was found firstly in Diepkloof Rock Shelter, its
                        a cave in Western Cape, South Africa. This cave is known for it's Stone Age art collection,
                        which is about 60,000 BCE. The rock shelter is almost 25 meters wide and 15 meters in depth and
                        were first investigated by Cefric Poggenpoel and John Parkington, in 1973. The excavation
                        continued in 1999, by the team Bordeaux and Cape Town under Pierre-Jean Texier, finding
                        archaeological layers of human occupation, about 45,000 - 130,000 BCE, these were not modern
                        humans. Since 1988, excavations have recovered 408 fragments of ostrich shells, all about 2-3cm
                        in size, and the pieces combined means 25 ostrich eggs, which tells us that Neanderthal people
                        have used them for daily life, a 1 litre water canisters.

                        Its a cave which is noted for one of the most important monuments of Paleolithic art in
                        Cantabria, and was also declared as the UNESCO World Heritage site since July 2008. Its located
                        in the middle of the Pas River valley, along with also the Cave of Hornos de la Pena and Monte
                        Castillo, they all are in the Puente Vieso county which is in Spain. This cave was discovered
                        back in 1911 by an anthropologist Hugo Obermaier and a French prehistorian Paul Wernert, while
                        they were exploring El Castillo Cave which is nearby. Later Henri Breuil and Hermilio Alcalde
                        del Rio joined them, and about 2 years later the 4 had published a monograph on the cave art
                        that they had found. About 40 years had gone by and the excavations begun which still continue
                        to this day. The cave overall is 400 meters long, where lies 4 different galleries, given easy
                        names - A, B, C and D. These galleries combined have about 700 seperate images where 60% of them
                        are abstract signs. Ibexes, a fish, 40 unidentified signs, horses, deers, aurochs, bisons,
                        goats, single mammoth and a megaloceros (extinct), are found in that cave, plus humanoid figures
                        and handprints. There are different types of abstract symbols which are dotted signs, linear
                        signs, tectiforms, claviform signs and polygona signs. For summary the cave has been occupied by
                        Neanderthals and at least the signs are dated back to 62,000 BCE.

                        Its a cave complex situated in the west of Serrezuela, about 600 meters above the sea level and
                        is only a few kilometers east of the village Ardales, Spain. This cave along with it's art was
                        found after the Alhama de Granada earthquake in 1821. A daughter of the Consul General in
                        Seville named Dona Trinidad Grund moved to Malaga at the age of 15, and had purchased the cave
                        in 1852 to turn it into a tourist attraction, fixed torches supports and built a staircase which
                        made it the first cave tourist attraction in Spain. In 1896 when she had passed away, then the
                        cave was fully abandoned, so in 1918 Henri Breuil decided to make deep examinations of the cave
                        that lasted for years. The cave has been now opened since 1985, containing Neanderthal artwork
                        where are over 1,000 cave paintings, like abstract signs, animals, handprints and stencils which
                        are covered in red and black. After making the uranium-thorium dating method, the red ochre
                        signs age turned out to be 63,000 BCE, meaning that these were indeed made by neanderthals.
                        Overall some of the cave art is only 10,000 years in difference, so that's why its the
                        Neanderthal occupied cave. Its a 1,577 meters long cave, containing different coloured images,
                        inside the temperature is about 16,5 C and is opened for everyone.

                        The Cave of Maltravieso is located in the city of Caceres which is in the Extremadura region in
                        western Spain. This cave was found in 1951, when an explosion revealed a deep hole in the rock
                        which was at a limestone quarry. There were found animal bones, human skulls, tools and
                        artifacts. A man named Carlos Callejo Serrano went inside and discovered the cave's art. The
                        most important ones are the hand stencils, because they are outlined in red ochre pigment, which
                        is normal, but some of the hands are missing their little fingers, reaching out to us a millenia
                        ago. Anthropologists call these handprints as the most important remains of Neanderthals due to
                        their hidden message. The hand stencils wasn't dated until 2018, when researchers from the
                        University of Southampton and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology decided to
                        investigate the stencils. They used uranium-thorium dating method and got a number of 64,700
                        BCE. There have been going excavations and found human occupation dating back to 350,000 BCE,
                        the excavations are still going there today. For summary the cave has 71 hand stencils along
                        with several animal paintings and abstract signs which were made by Neanderthals.

                        This little rock flake was in a dense deposit of artifacts, and found in Blombos Cave, South
                        Africa by an archaeologist team. It is believed that the cave wasn't for living, but for resting
                        point. Early <i>Homo sapiens</i> rested there for some minutes before going to hunt for food.
                        The stone tells us that even a 70,000 years ago, people were equally normal to us, behaviorally
                        modern. The rock flake's drawing isn't confirmed that its a drawing, it might have been a
                        message, but again the hashtag-like signs have been found on animal bones aswell, so it might
                        have been deliberate.

                        These are a series of caves situated near Humansdrop, its a small town which lies in the
                        Tsitsikamma coast, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. This site contains 3 main caves with 2
                        rock shelters, which is known as the Klasies River Main. These caves which are east of the
                        Klasies River Mouth, were first archaeologically investigated and found in the 1960s. Over the
                        years these caves have yielded dozens remains of artifacts, stone tools, human remains and more.
                        One of the first discoveries was in 1960, when Ray Inskeep and Ronald Singer found artifacts
                        which are from the Stone Age during excavating. In 1967 to 1968 John Wymer and Ronald Singer
                        started some bigger excavations which would give them more hundreds of artifact findings. The
                        excavations are still going there today. Over the years these caves have given human remains,
                        jawbones, postcranial bones, multiple foot bones, stone tools, bone tools and more. Overall alot
                        of remains that dates back to the prehistoric era, and these caves were occupied by the Modern
                        humans and Neanderthals, dating back to 10,000 - 125,000 BCE. The most important finding tho, is
                        a pebble which measures 7.5cm in length and has 23 parallel engraved lines where 7 of them have
                        deeply incised, broad grooves (this picture shows). Its not known whether these lines were made
                        deliberately or for a message. This fragment was dated back to 85,200 - 100,000 BCE.

                        Its a cave which is right at the sea level and is located near the city Cartagena which is in
                        southeastern Spain. The artwork discovery wasn't so long ago, it was in 2010 when researchers
                        found a pile of pierced sea shells that are decorated with red and yellow ochre pigments, under
                        the cave's overhaning cliff face. It is tought that the drilled holes in the shells were meant
                        to be as wearing as a jewellery by the occupants. For addition the excavations have yielded
                        Mousterian stone tools, animal teeth, dozens of bones and more shell containers including
                        residues of pigment textures from that cave. Overall it tells us that <i>Homo</i> Neanderthals
                        wore amulets, they were capable of producing the same art as modern humans (<i>Homo
                            sapiens</i>). Again using the Uranium-thorium dating method gave this artwork a number of
                        113,000 BCE.

This necklace was found in the Krapina Neanderthal Site which overlooks the Krapinica River and is located near the town Krapina, northern Croatia. This sandstone rock shelter was discovered by Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger in 1899, who did excavations there for 6 years. his excavations have yielded a large number of Neanderthal bones and teeth, along with about 800 Mousterian tools and artifacts. He also found several eagle claws where he talked about in his 2 monographs. He didn't think much of the white-tailed eagle claws, but he decided to take a closer look and examine these claws. Later the real discovery happened when researchers noticed a series of tool marks and notches on them, and were stated that the claws had been strung together and used as a necklace or a bracelet. This after turned these ancient eagle bones into priceless cache of prehistoric art. Whoever the person was who wore this around the neck, had sweated so much that certain areas of the claws had developed a polished appearance. Gorjanovic-Kramberger suggested that the animal bones are about 130,000 BCE, and he was right. It was later confirmed by the Uranium-thorium and Electron spin dating methods that gave this necklace a age of 130,000 BCE and is now known as the oldest necklace found in the world. It is also tought that Neanderthals used eagles for a symbolism and made accessories out of their bones.

It is another archaeological site that is situated near the village Quesang which is about 100 km northwest of Lhasa in Tibet, East Asia. The discovery was in 1988 when David Zhang spotted some children hand and foot prints on a giant soft rock, he is from the Guangzhou University, but it wasn't until In 2018, when this giant rock was investigated by a search team from Guangzhou and Bournemouth University, China, UK. They discovered it's parietal art which was exposed by the natural removal of an overlying block. This rock containing 5 hand and 5 foot prints which were made by 2 Neanderthal or <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://artslookup.com/prehistoric/denisovans.html">Denisovan</a> children, one of them was 5-year-old and the other one was a 12-year-old. It is tought that the children were just having fun, playing in the mud and placed their hands and feet on the rock which evolved as a message to us. Using the Uranium-thorium dating method, these prints were dated to be between 167,000 - 224,000 BCE. There are to be found alot of disagrees that these prints doesn't remain as art, but the research team believes that this is a valid rock art which made deliberately. Even if its not art, then it remains as the oldest hand and foot prints found in the world, dating back to the Neanderthal era.

Bruniquel Cave is near the commune Bruniquel which located in the Tarn-et-Garonne department that lies in the Occitanie region in southern France. This cave which is east of the Montauban county in southwestern France, was first investigated by some cavers who had to dig their way trough the collapsed entrance in 1990. The cave entrance was probably collapsed due to <a class="link1" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. They did find a burnt bone which was carbon-dated to about 45,600 BCE, but later the further explorations had stopped because the death of the leader archaeologist Francois Rouzaud, so they couldn't determine whether the cave was occupied by Neanderthals or not. The datings and studies began in 2013, when the Neanderthal scholar and professor of Paleolithic archaeology at University of Bordeaux Jacques Jaubert and his colleagues decided to explore the cave structures. This cave contains 2 ring-like structures that are made out of broken stalagmites which is about 330 meters from the entrance, one of them measures 6.7 by 4.5 meters in diameter and the other one 2.2 by 2.1 meters. Both the circles includes 1 to 4 layers of stalagmites, and overall about 400 pieces were used to build the upper structures which are weighting more than 2 tons. The bigger ring has commonly 34.4cm in length stalagmite pieces, and the smaller one with 29.5cm tall ones. This place was possibly used as a reunion where Neanderthals made bonfires to get warmth, cook their hunted food or even social ritualism. These circluar structures were dated close to 175,000 BCE using the uranium series dating methods. These structures remain as an artwork and are one of the oldest buildings made.

                        This figurine was discovered during an archaelogical survey by Lutz Fiedler, on the north bank
                        of the River Draa. It was lying between two layers, which were undisturbed. Its 5.8cm in height,
                        26cm in width, 1.2cm in thickness and weights about 10 grams. It is believed that the object was
                        made by a <i>Homo erectus</i>, but it is tought that the first art makers were Neanderthals. Its
                        dated to between 200,000 - 500,000 BCE. The gender of the figurine is unknown.

The Cave of Daraki-Chattan is a tight, small and deep cave which is in the Indragarh Hill that is in the Mandsaur division, Madhya Pradesh state in central India. This rock shelter was mainly discovered in 1992 by Ramesh Kumar Pancholi who is an archaeologist, but he didn't immediately start exploring the cave until 1995, when he investigated and talked about the site. In 2002 the excavations had started, but during the digging where found some 500 cupules in the walls, including 28 cupules in the fallen slabs. Kumar couldn't possibly spot the cupules because of the cave's tightness, at it's entrance is 1.4 meters in width and if you go little bit further then the width measures 34-40 cm where the height is 7.4 meters. Firstly not noticing the cupules, the cave's walls were peeled, so some of them was destroyed, but at least they duly launched an excavation of the layers of sediment around the entrace. The cupules are 4 meters above the floor level and they are dating back to the Late Acheulean period of the Stone Age which is between 200,000 - 500,000 BCE.

                        Venus of Berekhat Ram was discovered in the summer of 1981 by archaeologist N. Goren-Inbar, he
                        was from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. An archaeological survey was going on the Goal
                        Heights,
                        between Israel and Syria. Its hard to identify that the object looks like a figurine, but there
                        were left several traces that it was worked with a stone tool, which of course means human
                        action. Its a scoria pebble, which is 3.5cm in height, 2.5cm in width, 2.1cm thick and weights
                        approximately 10 grams. The mysterious thing is that The Venus of Tan-Tan and the Venus of
                        Berekhat Ram are pretty similar to eachother, they both weight about 10 grams and are about the
                        same size, meaning that they have been possibly used as an amulet, but its only my opinion. The
                        figure represents a female and found to be between 230,000-700,000 BCE.

                        This discovery was accidental. 1957, in the Raisen District of Madhya Pradesh, archaeologist Dr
                        Vishnu Wakankar spotted these signs from the train window while going to Nagpur. He took he's
                        team with him to look closer the rock art, dozens of images people on horses going on a battle.
                        This site has more than 750 rock shelters with 500 cave murals, 1,892 hectares of the area was
                        declared as protected under Indian, secondly an archaeological survey began in 1990 and it was
                        declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003. The very early excavations began in 1970s
                        and multiple shelters were investigated. In a deep cave in the Indragarh Hill, near Madhya
                        Pradesh, archaeologists found vertical panels roughly pitted with 498 cupules, probably used a
                        lower Paleolithic chopping tool. The cupules in the rock were dated back to 290,000 - 700,000
                        BCE and then some people painted several petroglyphs over the rock cupules which was given a
                        date of 7000 BCE. As I said earlier, there are alot of different paintings, its like a gallery
                        place where Prehistoric people have shared their ideas with eachother, including representations
                        of humans dancing and hunting, alot of hunting scenes, scenes that like fighting a boss,
                        mothers, children, pregnant women, men carrying dead animals, birds and burials appear in
                        rhythmic movement.

                        Bilzingsleben is an archaelogical site, lies in Thuringia, in the middle of Germany.
                        In 1969, paleontologist Dietrich Mania was doing a routine investigation in the village of
                        Bilzingsleben, who stumbled across a huge amount of animal bones, stone tools and artifacts. A
                        whole investigation was duly launched in the village (1971), and the following year Dietrich
                        discovered a fragment of a human occipital bone. The site has provided about 28 skull remains, 9
                        individual teeth and part of a jaw bone, which have been tought that these are from <i>Homo
                            erectus</i>. Lastly there were found some large animal bones, one of them belonging to
                        forest elephant which was a shinbone having 14 parallel lines engraved into it's surface. There
                        were more bones which had deliberate abstract engravings on them, dating to be about
                        350,000-400,000 BCE. These marked signs were classified as art, because of the deliberateness,
                        but there are people who are doubdting about the age, whether its an art or they are just
                        doodles, using the lasermicroscopic analysis. Luckily there is a engraving on an elephant foot
                        bone which was indeed deliberate and were agreed that its an art.

                        In 1891, on the banks if the Bengawan Solo river in East Java, a Dutch anatomist and geologist
                        named Eugene Dubois was just collecting hundreds of freshwater mussel shells, while of the
                        samples was having an engraving. It was immediately tought by Dr Stephen Munro that the
                        engraving is an art, without doubt. Its confirmed that the art was made by <i>Homo erectus</i>.
                        The site included a large amount of fossils, bones, artifacts and big freshwater mussel shells
                        which belonged to the sub-pieces <i>Pseudodon vondembuschianus trinilensis</i> (now extinct).
                        The shells were studied by Josephine Joordens and found that they are the oldest found abstract
                        signs in the world. The art was likely made with a shark's tooth, a really sharp tool that made
                        the art survive all these years. The picture shows the oldest one, covered with a zigsag pattern
                        which was dated to 430,000-540,000 BCE.
