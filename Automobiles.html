                        The first ever car-like machine was built in 1770 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot who built a
                        self-propelled vehicle, well we can't really call this a car, because it has no engine. This
                        machine had several problems tho, the amount of water this could have wasn't much and the steam
                        pressure was not strong enough to get this trycycle going faster. It was going at a speed of 3.6
                        kilometers per hour (3.6km/h) when carrying 4 passengers which was the max capacity it could
                        carry, but the top speed was 7.8 km/h when there was only the driver. Overall this vehicle had 3
                        wheels, one front, 2 wheels back, supported a steam boiler and the driving mechanism did exist.
                        In 2010 a replica of this machine was made and worked perfectly well.

                        Some 30 years later after Cugnot's Fardier a vapeur, Richard Trevithick who is born in Cornwall,
                        England, built a locomotive-like vehicle that was named "Puffing Devil". The steam engine was
                        made by Scotsman James Watt, which had a pressure of 145 psi (pounds per square inch). It had a
                        pressure-operated piston connected to a cylindrical horizontal boiler, but litteraly few days
                        later the machine was destroyed due to overheat and burned down. It originally rode on rails,
                        but there was the second problem that it was so heavy, it broke it's rails and retired after 3
                        trips. In 2017 was made the replica.

                        The first gas engine was made by Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir who was a Belgian engineer. The
                        international combustion engine was made using a jumping spark ignition system where sparks
                        ignited a coal gas mixture and oxygen inside a one cylinder engine. This vehicle got into
                        production and by 1865, 143 of these were sold in Paris and the production of the engine in
                        London begun. After Joseph's death, a month had passed and on July 16, 1900, the Automobile Club
                        of France said - "<i>In recognition of his great merits as an inventor of the gas engine and
                            builder of the first car in the world</i>". This message didn't age well because it was
                        never meant to be a car, but an engine. Originally it was this motor that became popular and
                        later he just slapped the engine on a 3-wheeled wagon, but it still remains a vehicle that is
                        powered with a 1-cylinder engine and has a little car looking that with a headlight.

                        Its a driveable vehicle that was built around a boiler from a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merryweather_%26_Sons">Merryweather & Sons</a> fire
                        engine, that could carry total of 8 people. A collabration began in 1874, a team planned to make
                        steam-powered road vehicle that can carry passengers, and the collabration lasted for 15 years.
                        It has a steering wheel which is turned by a tiller at the front, and 2 wheels on the rear,
                        lying on the driven axle. There are 2 parallel seats that can carry 6 passengers. You actually
                        need several people to keep this thing going, a fireman needs to sit at the rear, stock the fire
                        and preserve the water level in the boiler. The brake does exist which is the foot pedal and
                        this thing can go 32 km/h, but consuming a ton of supplies, (about 20 liters of water and 2.5 kg
                        of coal per mile).

                        A person named Siegried Marcus built a automobile in 1875 which runned on gasoline and powered
                        by a 4-cycle engine. We can still call this thing a car because it was a driveable gasoline
                        powered vehicle. Its known as the first vehicle that used gasoline as fuel. He made several
                        different models and the 3rd and 4th version did not survive on the road, this is why we call
                        this the second car, it was the only vehicle that had survived on the road and was actually
                        driveable. Originally he began building the self-propelled car in 1860, then 15 years later the
                        second car concept was finished in his factory in Vienna. Firstly equipped with a 2-cycle engine
                        and later a 4-cycle one. The controversy is that this machine is known as the first car ever
                        made, and thats not true, because it wasn't a production vehicle, so its not replacing the Benz
                        Patent-Motorwagen first place. It would have reached the first car ever made if there were sold
                        atleast 35 copies.

                        Its known as the first real car, built in 1885 by Carl Benz and also the first production car
                        which was 600 imperial German marks (around 5,000$ today). It had 3 wheels, one front, 2 back,
                        and had a rear engine which runned on gasoline-powered <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine">two-stroke</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocating_engine">piston engine</a>.
                        The wheels were made out of steel where Benz came and put rubber tires to the wheels, because it
                        wasn't meant to be a train, but a car. Now we don't call this 100kg engine "Pressure", but now
                        its horsepower, this thing had 0.9 hp at 400 rpm (rpm is car acceleration), and was capable of
                        going 16 km/h (10 mph). Later he produced more powerful models, one of them were named <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler_Stahlradwagen">Stahlradwagen</a> which was the
                        nr 2 model that had a 1.5hp engine and model nr 3 having 2hp engine. The main materials were
                        steel and wood.

                        It was the first Peogeot's company car ever which was made in 1886. Its a vehicle designed by
                        Leon Serpollet who presented it in the same year when it was finished. Its a 3-wheeled machine
                        that has 1-cylinder engine with poppet valves and crank cases, including an oil-fired boiler. Im
                        putting this thing on the list because, just a year after the first car ever made, this thing
                        could go 25 km/h and had 5 hp. I mean people started to know the basics of a car and there on
                        cars were getting much faster.

                        The Flocken Elektrowagen is known as the first electric car (also having 4 wheels), made by
                        Andreas Flocken. Its a car that was made out of a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaise">chaise</a> and was equipped with an electric
                        motor. Its an iron-tyred carriage wagon with an output of 0.9 kW (1 hp), weights 400 kg, capable
                        of going at the speed of 15 km/h, electric headlights, has a battery box over the front axle,
                        springs, and a stub axle steering. The manufacturer was the Maschinenfabrik A. Flocken, where
                        automobile construction ended in 1903.

                        There were these two Santler brothers named Charles and Walter who ran a small engineering
                        company by their father in 1875. They had moved into a bicycle business, there in 1887 they
                        designed a small working steam engine which was installed on a 4-wheeled body. Some years later
                        after experimenting with different solutions to get this car actually going, it was finally
                        finished in 1901, a 2 seater with a 1-cylinder engine that had a central gearbox and chain
                        installed to the rear wheels. They have made more models which one of them was a 4-cylinder
                        engine model that sold for about £180, but it was finished in 1913.

                        This machine is known as the first taxi cab in London, built by Walter Bersey in 1897. Going at
                        the maximum speed of 19 km/h (12 mph), this vehicle could carry 2 passengers and a driver.
                        Unfortunately the batteries and tyres had been damaged by the weight of this thing, and the
                        worst part was the replacement due to the expenses, so later they were not profitable anymore.
                        They withdrew these vehicles in August 1899 and were no longer on the road in London. They had
                        8hp and weighted 2 tons, made by the Great Horseless Carriage Company.

                        A guy named George Foote Foss who had a small store where he offered bicycle repair,
                        blacksmithing and machining. One day when visiting Boston, Massachusetts, he was riding an <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brougham_(carriage)">electric brougham</a>, after the
                        ride he became interested in automobiles. In December of 1896 he began building a 4-horsepower,
                        single-cylinder automobile which took about 4 months, so it was finished in the spring of 1897.
                        It was the first vehicle that was built in Canada, having a front mounted engine because it
                        reduced the vibration through the seat and going at the speed of 24 km/h where this machine
                        could climb steep hills. After 4 years of driving this machine, he sold it for $75 in 1902. None
                        of them existed today, so the Legendary Motor Car Company which lies in Halton Hills, built a
                        replica for the 125 anniversary. What this story tells us? - Having a small workshop which is
                        going to be a big win.

                        The first vehicle factories had problems copying cars in the early and mid 19th centuries,
                        people have been reporting that something is wrong with their bought cars, so it had to happen
                        in 1897, when Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriks-Gesellschaft A.G company made an actually working
                        factory produced car that didn't whine after days of driving. Its a petrol-engined automobile
                        made in Austria-Hungary along with Central and Eastern Europe. It was constructed by Leopold
                        Svitak and Hans Ledwinka. Originally the body was meant to be a carriage but they made it a car,
                        which had <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_handlebar#History">handlebar</a> steering,
                        wooden body placed on an iron frame, 4 seats where it includes convertible top to the rear
                        seats. It had horse carriage wheels which were equipped with rubber tires, and a 2-cylinder
                        spark ignition engine (Benz's engine), placed by the rear semi-elliptical leaf spring axle.

                        Renault Voiturette means that they have made 5 models. Louis Renault made the first model in
                        1898, which contained a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Dion-Bouton">De Dion-Bouton engine</a>. It was a 1
                        cylinder engine that could go much faster than other earlier made vehicles, producing a speed of
                        32 km/h. He offered it to one of his friend's father on December 24, which he sold it to, and
                        after making 12 more of these which were sold too. Im putting this car on the list because of
                        it's speed, handling, fuel economy and of course Renault's first car made. The other 4 models
                        weren't so important, the other versions had tops and pretty much the same working.

                        Total of 24 of these has been which means that it wasn't a production car, but at least Fiat's
                        first car. A man named Giovanni Ceirano started making these cars in 1899 with his coachworker
                        Marcello Alessio. In July 1899, the Welleyes patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli who made the
                        4 HP ones out of the bought vehicles. This car has 0.7-liter water-cooler with 2-cylinder
                        rear-mounted engine that produced 4.2 hp and a three-speed gearbox. Going even faster than the
                        Renault Voiturette, it was capable of going 35 km/h which consumed 8 liters of fuel per 100
                        kilometers. Still 4 of these remain today in museums, 2 in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Nazionale_dell%27Automobile">Automobile Museum of

                        In 1900 the first ever racing car was built in only 5 weeks by Hans Ledwinka. It was one the
                        first races too, when this vehicle raced with 4 Benz-cars and 4 Dietrich-Bollee cars in Vienna
                        Prater, and later this one was choosed to be a pure racing car. This machine had no bodywork
                        because it would have made the vehicle heavier, a modified Benz engine that was a 2-cylinder
                        spark ignition engine. All these mechanics combined made this vehicle have 12 horsepower at 1800
                        RPM. It had 2 gas tanks, one had a volume of 42 liters and the other was behind the driver which
                        was a tank of 15 liters of coolant. This car has influenced everything in automobiles, because
                        it was able to reach a maximum speed of 82 km/h - It told people that they are capable of doing
                        better in at least speed.

                        Ferdinand Porsche was a 23-year-old gentleman who was hired by Jacon Lohner, he wanted him to be
                        an electric powertrain engineer for his coaches in Vienna, Austria Hungary. Firstly coming to
                        the job, he didn't have much education, but on one day at Lohner-Werke, he built a drivetrain
                        with low-friction by mounting the motors to the hubs. The motors had about 3 - 7hp. Its kind of
                        a long story tho, so I'm not going to talk about it here, but the vehicle was finished in 1900,
                        which required about 2 tons of 80 volt and lead-acid batteries that had to be encased in a
                        spring-suspended container to protect the cells. The batteries had a power of 1,280 electric
                        motors that moved this 4.4 ton of a vehicle. Overall this thing turned out be a litteral tank
                        with 56 hp, and Porsche was ahead of his time.

                        This car was built in 1901 by Paul Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. A year later after the
                        Rennzweier, abruptly this car came with 3 times more horsepower and not even meant to be a race
                        car, but a road machine. The car was tested in January 1901 and was said that this car is not
                        really for racing due to it's worse handling than Rennzweier. The car made it to the production
                        car, 36 produced with the top speed of 51 km/h. This engine was a 230 kg light motor which was
                        placed at the front of the car, including 2 brakes - one was a handbrake which acted on the
                        front wheels that had 30 cm drums, and other was the foot brake - It acted on the chain drive's
                        intermediate shaft that was water-cooled. For summary this car has been regarded as the first
                        modern car, because of it's looking and the system that it had was unusual at the time.

                        Its a 2-seater horseless carriage that was finished in 1902 by Cadillac Automobile Company, but
                        the motor was developed Henry Martyn Leland. It had a single-cylinder engine that had 10 hp and
                        was pretty reliable. They have made several models after this one, but they aren't that
                        important because the other versions just had different looking and the same horsepower. After
                        the models were finished, they were displayed at the New York Auto Show, where people were
                        impressed by the vehicles and gathered about 2,000 firm orders.

                        Its also known as "the car of three firsts", that was commisioned by Jacobus Spijker in 1903 and
                        was meant to be a race car because it after went to the Paris-Madrid race. The building started
                        way earlier, when blacksmiths Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker made the first 6-cylinder engine
                        in 1880, and later the car was equipped with a first 4-wheel braking system aswell. The car
                        wasn't ready for race until December 1903, in Paris. 2 months later it went to display at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace">The
                            Crystal Palace</a> in London. This car have raced only twice - one time was at Blackpool,
                        where it finished third and later in 1904, at Birmingham, it won. This car is now at the Louwman
                        Museum, which is in The Hauge, Netherlands.

                        This luxury car company built their first car in 1904 what was a 10 hp one. Charles Rolls and
                        Henry Royce produced the first car on 23 December 1904, and was badged as Rolls-Royce. The
                        twin-cylinder engine had a water-cooler, with an output of 12 hp this machine could reach 63
                        km/h, including overhead inlet, side exhaust valves and a transmission brake operated by foot
                        pedal which is fitted behind gearbox. Firstly they tought to make 20 of these, turned out only
                        16 and didn't make it to the production car. The last 10 hp one was made in 1906 and there on
                        they were making more powerful versions.

                        Originally this car was meant to compete with other electric cars used in towns, that was built
                        in 1905 by Rolls-Royce. The engine was mounted under the car to give the appearance of town <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brougham_(car_body)">brougham</a>, and to reduce all
                        these vibrations and smokes. Normally a V-8 engine screams, but this one was quiet, because the
                        power was made to be limited due to the smooth running. This thing could go 42 km/h but it was
                        reduced to 32 km/h due to legal speed limit. Overall due to it's low speed it was designed to
                        compete with popular electric cars in towns, and it was an absolute concept car, only 3 produced
                        which none of them exist anymore.

                        The Ross automobile company built this machine in 1906, which was powered by 2 steam engines.
                        Both engines independently powered a rear wheel, and also having different speed controls. It
                        was dangerous to drive this thing because it would go down the course moving side to side. It
                        raced one mile straight at Ormond-Daytona Beach, competing against 90 hp Napier and W K
                        Vanderbilt's 90 hp Mercedes, and the Wogglebug won it in 38.05s, being the first American driver
                        to complete a mile course in under a minute. At the time the car cost $2800 which is now
                        $95,000, so he couldn't mass produce the car, especially for avarage costumers. The
                        Ormond-Daytona Beach is now the birthplace of speed.

                        It was a bigger 5-litre luxury car made by the British manufacturer Austin. It had 30 hp due to
                        tax purposes and pundits, the next year it was replaced with a new engine called <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_15/20">the Austin 15-20</a>
                        engine, containing 4-cylinders. They decided to make only 4 of these machines so they remained
                        as concept cars.

                        Why the Ford Model T was a successful vehicle? - because the Ford Motor Company used assembly
                        line production instead of handcrafting, and provided inexpensive transportation on a large
                        scale. This car was designed by Eugene Farkas, Childe Harold Wills and Joseph A.Galamb. It
                        became a powerful symbol of the United States age of modernization, 15 million produced which
                        means that it was one of the most successful cars in the history. The first production model was
                        built on August 12, 1908, and some days later after the release were sold about 15,000 copies.
                        The engine cave this machine 20 hp, meaning that it had a top of 68 km/h. The first 2,450 units
                        had coolers which were water pumps, and there on they decided to replace the cooling with <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosiphon">thermosiphon
                            action</a>. For summary this car was in produce for 33 years (ended in 1941), including
                        slight upgrades overtime, (the last version was the 1925 Ford T Tudor sedan).

                        January 18 to February 2, 1908). It was a sidevalve straight-4 engine equipped racing car with
                        28 hp and a 4 speed manual gearbox, that had a top speed of 90 km/h. Over 100 copies were ever
                        sold, and later the same year they built a faster one which was the Lancia 18/24 HP Dialfa.

                        It was made by the Germany automobile maker Opel, which is also known as the "doctor car"
                        (<i>Doktorwagen</i> in Germany), because this car was compared to others and was often used by
                        many doctors for house calls. It was a successful model because of the simple mechanics it had,
                        including a low price of 3,950 German marks. It could go 60 km/h with it's 8 hp and 525kg of
                        weight, that was a 4-cylinder engine containing a water-cooler. The production was from 1909 to
                        1910.

                        A man named Ettore Bugatti had the plan to make a sturdy, lightweighted car, so he began developing it in 1908. He had been studied about vehicles earlier, when he initially worked for E.C.C Mathis and De Dietrich. In 1909, the car was finished, being a 2-seated, 365 kilogram vehicle that had 10 PS acceleration and could reach a top speed of 80 km/h. The overhead camshaft runned 2 valves per cylinder suspended in a cast-iron block. Then he continued to make the car even more powerful with his team where he called the modified car "Type 13", and used the name Bugatti this time. Type 13 had a 4-cylinder, 1.4 L engine that had a power of 15 PS, and could reach 90 km/h. Both these cars were really ahead of their time and they were indeed a big achivement.

                        The Audi Type A was the first automobile built by the Audi company. In May 1910 the car made it
                        to the production, total of 140 copies sold. It was designed by August Horch and Herman, that
                        has a 4-cylinder engine with half a litre in capacity which made it equip with 22 horsepower
                        that could go 75 km/h. Its a pretty lightweight car that has a number of 830 kilograms and have
                        entered dozens of races, including the Austrian Alpine Rally. The production have discontinued
                        since 1912, but at least sold more than hundred of them.

                        It was a luxury car introduced in 1910, Italy. Isotta Fraschini decided to make 50 of these
                        beasts that contain a 10.6 litre engine with 140 hp and could go 160 km/h. There were actually 2
                        engine options, one was the Italian which had 120 hp and a top speed of 130 km/h and the other
                        one what I just mentioned, its the American option. The motor was a new aeroengine design with
                        bi-block cylinders, 4 large valves for one cylinder. This car also has brakes for all wheels,
                        including front wheel and rear brakes that was developed by Oreste Fraschini.

                        It had different variations such as the CG, ES and JP, but the original CV had a 6-cylinder 7.5

                        It was a machine that was produced from 1911 to 1914 by the British car company Vauxhall. Its
                        often considered as the first sports cars due to it's high performance. These cars entered the
                        1900 km long <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prinz-Heinrich-Fahrt">1910 Motor Trials</a>, named in
                        honour of Prince Henry of Russia. Copies of the trial cars were made that sold pretty quickly
                        and got it's name Prince Henry Vauxhall. The engine had 4 cylinders that was the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine">monoploc</a> design
                        with side valves, and a 30 kW output. 3 out of these cars entered the RAC 2,000-mile race, and

                        There was a guy named Horacio Anasagasti, he was a student of German engineer Otto Krause. After
                        he created his own workshop, he found the Anasagasti company in 1909, where he repaired
                        agricultural engines, automobiles and also planes, well aviation. In 1910 he decided to
                        represent his first prototype at the Exposicion Internacional de Ferrocarriles y Transportes
                        Terrestes (International Exhibition of Railways and Land Transportation). It initially had a
                        4-cylinder inline engine with 4-speed gearbox, but after the trip to Europe to find some
                        vendors, he finally had created his first vehicle, which was a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_(automobile)">Ballot</a>-engined car with 15 hp.
                        This car with French engine and Argentine body was shown on September 17 in the
                        Rosario-Cordoba-Rosario race. There was put a price tag of $6500 on this machine in 1912. The
                        same year this car had competed in the Tour de France, and was the winner of the 1515 km
                        Paris-Madrid race. When Anasagasti returned to Argentina, he planned to make 50 of these models,
                        but the World War I made the things difficult so the company was closed in 1915

                        the British Army in World War I, they used these as staff cars. They were sufficiently heavy for
                        war use, and later were re-tuned with a power of 60 hp that could go over 100 km/h. Overall
                        these cars were used by senior military officers, a good use with it's 6-cylinder engine that

                        It was made by the Italian can manufacturer ALFA which is now known as Alfa Romeo. Its one of
                        these cars that has got several innovations over the years (1913 to 1922). The automobile was
                        designed by Giuseppe Merosi, and had a straight-4 engine with overhead valves which produced 70
                        PS and had a top speed of 125 km/h. They have also made the 40-60 HP Corsa racing version that
                        could go 137 km/h and has won the Parma-Berceto race. More of these cars were produced after the
                        World War I, and had even a higher top speed of 150 km/h where it won the 1920 and 1921 races at
                        Mugello. The last version weights 1,100 kg, has a top speed of 150 km/h what I just mentioned,
                        and was based on ladder chassis which gave this car lightweight. The fuel tank capacity
                        increased from 70 L to 120 L (the racing version).

                        production had started in 1913 and was considered as the "people's car" for the mass market with
                        it's comfort. It was designed by Frantisek Kec who gave it all-independent suspension and a side
                        valve engine. On the first year it was already succesful seller, but little bit later the market
                        was closed due to war, so it was resumed in 1923. In 1927 the new model was introduced with it's
                        6 cylinder engine. The 1913 version (Alfa 5/15HP), however had a front-mounted inline-4 engine
                        which produced 15 hp with 4-speed manual transmission. The top speed was 56 km/h due to it's
                        lightweight of 750 kilograms. Later in 1927 the new model Alfa 8/25HP was introduced that had
                        this time a water-cooled 6-cylinder engine that gave the vehicle 34 hp. It was also the smallest
                        6-cylinder engine in Czechoslovakia at the time. The Last version was the 1932 one that had 38hp
                        and could go 90 km/h. The production ended in 1942 with 9,257 vehicles made.

                        The car company Fiat has made dozens of great cars in the 20th century, so that's why Fiat was
                        basically everywhere, due to it's different variety of cars made. One of them was the Fiat 70
                        that was produced between 1915 and 1920. It used a 2-liter straight-four engine which produced
                        21 hp and was capable going at a maximum speed of 70 km/h. This car contained full eletrical
                        system, so the vehicle was ahead of it's time, and a 4-speed manual transmission. Almost all of
                        them went to the Italian army. After about 1,000 of these 1,735 kg weighted automobiles made,
                        they were replaced by the Fiat 501.

                        This luxurious and large automobile was first introduced in September 1914 by Cadillac, where
                        the company referred this as the 1915 model. This machine replaced the 4-cylinder <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Model_Thirty">Model 30</a> with it's L-head V8
                        engine which produced 77 hp. They decided to make different models over the years, so the first
                        one was the Type 51, second - 1916 Type 53, third - 1917 Type 55, fourth - 1918 Type 57, Fifth -
                        1919 Type 57, Sixth - the same version that got some upgrades, seventh - 1920/1921, more
                        upgrades and eighth - 1922/1923 Type 61. Overall the Type 51 remains as the most important
                        version because it was one of the first V8 cars that was mass produced. In that time they were
                        sold for US$3,600, and all of these versions combined were sold total of 41,001 cars.

                        This simple lightweight, 2-seated American automobile was manufactured by the A.O. Smith Company in Milwaukee in 1915 to 1920. They made a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclecar">cyclecar</a> that has wooden frame and a good suspension. Back of the car was the fifth wheel where a small gasoline engine was mounted. This motor was developed by Arthur William Wall who was from Birmingham, England, it was originally meant to power a bicycle, but now it was slapped on a small 5-wheeled machine. First they tought to put a Ferdinand Porsche electric wheel on this thing, but later it was equipped with the Wall motorwheel instead, that required the U.S. manufacturing rights, and this car was called the "Smith Motorwheel". In 1919 the Briggs & Stratton Company purchased the manufacturing rights, and there on they made several improvements in the engine. They increased the bore size, along with a new all steel connecting rod and a flywheel magneto. Now the power output was 2hp and could go 40-48 km/h. In 1922 the car was selling for $125 to $150 and was also listed to the Guinness Book Of Records as the most inexpensive car of all time.

                        It was built in 1917 by the Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company, is a member of the Mitsubishi corporate group that later changed to Mitsubishi Motors. It was also the first production automobile in Japan. This car was pretty similar to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Tipo_3">Fiat Tipo 3</a>, a 4-door, 7-seat sedan that was powered by a front-mounted 35hp straight-4 engine, and was capable going at a maxiumum speed of 97 km/h. They built 22 of these at the Kobe shipyard between 1917 - 1921, including some prototypes. Initially it was meant to compete with cheaper American and European cars, but later in 1921 the production stopped because they were expensive to produce and made with pure hands. In the end pretty much everything was dead, they did not make any cars until the 1960s, when the Mitsubishi 500 arrived.

This automobile has got several improvements over the years (1918 - 1927), in 1918 it was shown as mid-range model, and later in the 1920s it was available in different body styles. In 1927 this vehicle renamed from Studebaker Special Six to Studebaker Special Six Commander, and later in 1928 the was shortened to Studebaker Commander. The 1918 version was powered by a side-valve, 3.2-litre 4-cylinder engine which delivered this machine 40hp and the top speed is unknown.

                        It was the first car made by Citroën, that was produced in Paris and France from June 1919 to December 1921. Initially André Citroën was producing ammunition for World War I, but in 1917 he investigated the development of a medium range car, which was under the direction of Jules Salomon. After the car was finished, it had a water-cooled 4-cylinder engine that gave the machine 18 hp and it's maximum was 65 km/h. A hand lever controlled the rear wheel braking, including a foot pedal that runned the transmission brake. On the releasing year the Type A cost 7,950 francs, but later was increased to 12,500 francs. A total of 24,093 of these were built, where they produced 100 of these per day, and later became the first mass production manufacturer in Europe.

                        It was a luxury machine produced between 1919 and 1924 by the manufacturer Isotta Fraschini. This was also the first car equipped with a straight-8 engine where the company gained much more fame and was overall a great luxury car manufacturer. The production was unique because the Tipo 8 offered only with a bare chassis and engine for the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachbuilder">coachbuilders</a>. This 5.9-liter overhead cam and overhead valve was the first inline 8 engine that was in production. Firstly it had 80 hp, but soon raised to 90hp where the car's top speed was 137 km/h with it's 3-speed manual transmission. 1,380 of these were ever built.

Its mainly known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight where it was first shown in New York City, late 1920. On one time the production had stopped because the company moved it's factory and headquarters from New Jersey to Indiana, and Fred Duesenberg decided to redesign specific parts of the car, so the real production started in late 1921. The Duesenberg Straight Eight used <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation">Lockheed Corporation</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_brake">Hydrualic brakes on all wheels</a> where the front wheels were finned to dissipate heat with their 16 inches in diameter. They planned to make literally 100 cars every month, but in the end of 1922 the production had been going for a whole year and it reached a number of roughly 150 cars. Later in October 1926 the company was purchased by another company <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errett_Lobban_Cord">E.L.Cord</a> who built about 500 more of them. The production ended in late 1926 and over 650 of these cars were ever manufactured.

                        This car called the 7/9CV was made by the low volume producer Louis Chenard in 1920. It featured a 4-cylinder, 1¼-litre engine, including 3-speed manual transmission. In October 1924 he mainly focused 2 models where one of them was the Type D and the other one was the second Type D, but more powerful. Both these cars were put to market in 1924, the Type D cost 18,000 francs and the better version - 22,900 francs. One of the Loius Chenard cars had competed in the 24 Hour Race in 1924, which was driven by Loius Chenard himself with a family member as co-driver. It competed with 38 other cars where it retired after 13 laps, which placed this machine 32nd out of the 39 cars.

The G1 model had 6.3 L straight-6 engine which gave this vehicle 68 hp and could reach 138 km/h. It also won it's production class at the Coppa del Garda race. A total of 52 of these cars were ever made.

                        Originally it was meant to be a chassis but remains as a car that was manufactured by Bentley. The Bentley 3 Litre was built in 1919 and was available to coachbuilders from 1921 to 1929. A very advanced straight-4 engine designed by ex-<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> engineer Clive Gallop, was put on the car which was also the first engine with 4 valves per cylinder, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_sump">dry-sump lubrication</a> and an overhead camshaft. This motor gave this car 70 hp and could reach it's top speed of 129 km/h, but there was also a Speed Model which had a top speed of 145 km/h, and the fastest version which reached a top speed of 161 km/h, was the Super Sports model. These were the 3 variants that they offered - Blue label - the standard one, Red label - the speedy one, and the Green label which had the highest performance along with the top speed. The production ended in 1929 with a total of 1,624 cars made.

                        Between the years 1922 to 1927, Alfa Romeo made 3 different versions of RL, where the first one was the Normale, built by Giuseppe Merosi. It was equipped with a straight-6 engine that had overhead valves, and a top speed of 110 km/h (55 hp). Then in 1923, came the race version of RL (sport), where it weighted only half of the other versions which was 980 kg, and having 94 hp attracted it to 157 km/h. Then the third version was the Turismo, it almost has the same looking as the Normale, but had little bit more horsepower, 60, and was the topless model with an 2996 cc engine displacement. Total of 2,640 RL cars were made. Picture shows the racing version, only 2 of these cars completed the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia">Mille Miglia</a> race in 1927.

                        In 1922 the company Bamford & Martin decided to produce cars for racing. So they built 2 cars that had 16-valve twin-cam engines, competing at the Brooklands racing circuit, and also for the customers where one of the cars (registration number OR1) was later re-built as the AM Halford and then a bit later it was re-built again as the Halford Special. In 1924 the car was crashed and Major Halford tought to buy the chassis where he installed a complete new engine on his own. The machine wasn't equipped with 1 engine, but 2 this time, both of them were 1.5L, 6-cylinder <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_engine">in-line</a> engines where each of them had an aluminium cylinder-block with crankcase that had steel liners, having rubber seals at their base. The cylinder heads were malm with 2 camshafts, along with 12 inclined valves and 2 twelve mm plugs per cylinder. In the earlier times he had been learning about aircraft designs, so later had the idea to make the car even more powerful by using Frank Halford's turbocharger. Halford Special was now equipped with a turbocharger, but turned out that it was unreliable in tests, and they had to uninstall it, unfortunately it didn't remain as the first car with a turbocharger. In 1925, on the first race the vehicle had 95 hp, but in 1926 the 2-seater was equipped with a larger radiator, containing 125 hp. The car has set some top speed records with a 193 km/h attraction and overall it has raced in 1926 Grand Prix at Brooklands where the car finished fifth because during the race a prop-shaft universal joint was broken, so the car had to retire after 82 laps, total of 3 cars finished the race.

                        The manufacturer Chrysler has made multiple versions of Chrysler Six from 1924 to 1935. So why was it popular? - due to it's large selection of models and the advanced engine system where the cars have even entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1925, 1928 and 1929. The main model what we are talking about is the Model B-70, because it was the first Chrysler Six version that was produced from 1924 to 1925. Five lug nuts were attached to hydrualic 4-wheel drum brakes, where already 32,000 of Model B-70's were sold in the of 1924. They overall have made 8 different models, for example was the 4-door Town Car version that cost US$3,725. The company offered different body and technology choices that cost extra money. The top speed of the cars were about 112 - 120 km/h. The Series C-6 Business Coupe was the last version, produced in 1935.

                        The Italian manufacturer Isotta Fraschini decided to mass-produce a luxury car from 1924 to 1931. It came from the Tipo 8 model, but with a more powerful 7.3L, straight-8 engine that gave this vehicle almost 158 hp, and could go over 150 km/h with it's 3-speed manual, well Isotta Fraschini at least promised that way. The company only offered this car as a chassis and engine for the coachbuilders. The body on its own was made by the Switzerland manufacturer <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrosserie_Worblaufen">Carrosserie Worblaufen</a>.

                        The Opel Laubfrosch, originally named Opel 4 PS was introduced in 1924 by the automobile maker Opel. It was initially manufactured at Opel's <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCsselsheim_am_Main">Rüsselsheim</a> factory, where the vehicle was put on a Ford production line. It was equipped with a 4-cylinder engine that had 4 <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_horsepower#Germany">tax horsepower</a>, with a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosiphon#Engine_cooling">Thermosyphon</a> watercooler and gave it a 12 PS output, where the top speed was 66 km/h. It had a 3-speed transmission to the rear wheels as well. For summary, it was a really successful car due to it's low price which was 4,500 German Marks, where it contained some high performance compared to it's price. The production ended in June 1931, with 119,484 cars made, and later was replaced by the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_1,2_Liter">Opel 1.2 litre</a>.

                        It's successor was the Type MT and Type KJ, where Renault introduced the NN at the 1924 Mondial de l'Automobile show in Paris. It was basically the MT upgrade that had a larger wheelbase, lenghtier body, and included front-wheel brakes this time. In 1927 appeared the NN1 where it's fenders were rounder and was equipped with bumpers. In 1928 came the NN2 which was heavier and had more significant looking. They produced a huge number of 150,000 of these NN vehicles that could reach 70 km/h with it's 3-speed transmission. For addition the weight of the versions were 1,150 to 1,550 kg, and offered them as small family cars. The versions were - 4-door sedan, 2/4-door torpedo, and 2-door coupé.

                        Its a small car which is also called cyclecar, and was produced between 1925 - 1926 by Gnome Cars Ltd in London. The vehicle was equipped with a rear-mounted 2 stroke, 1-cylinder engine that included an air cooler. The 2-seater had a body made of steel and plywood. It remains kind of a weird vehicle in the 1920s due to it's low suspension. It had almost no suspension at all, the tyres were inflated to 6 psi. Initially the car was £75, then later raised up to £100, including an electric starter, and about 60 of these were ever made. A buyable car but hard to get at that time.

The 2/10 PS means "2 taxable/ 10 brake horsepower" and has a 0.5 litre, single-cylinder rear engine that gifted the car with 10 hp and could go 60 km/h. The fuel consumption was 4 liters per 100 kilometers, so it was an economy car as well. It was also the most fuel efficient mass-production car in the world between the both World Wars. 15,775 of these one headlighted were produced between 1925 to 1928. Usually the German army used this loaf of bread shape on their cars, which they called <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommissbrot"><i>Kommisbrot</i></a>, which means "Army Bread".

                        Produced from 1926 to 1930 with 544 cars made in total, the first ones weren't introduced until 1928. After one of the vehicles driven by Woolf Barnato in 1930 who participated in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Train_Races">Blue Train Races</a>, these cars became the <i>Blue Train Bentleys</i>. In 1924 Bentley decided to build a more powerful version than the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_3_Litre">3 Litre</a>, with also a larger chassis. They firstly introduced the 6½ Liter, where the vehicle contained a straight-6 engine with 4 valves per cylinder, overhead camshaft, and a single-piece engine block along with cylinder head cast in iron. This car being with it's 4-wheel brake system had 147 hp, where it could go 135 km/h. Later in 1928, the Bentley Speed Six was introduced with it's bigger body. It included a high performance camshaft and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU_carburettor">2 SU carburettors</a> along with a single-port block. They included the racing verions of the Speed Six, where these cars have won 2 times in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, because this time the engines contained 200 hp and could go 201 km/h, that was a new speed record at the time.

                        The Pontiac 6 was Pontiac's first car which was produced from 1926 to 1932. Firstly it came as the Series 6-27 where it used <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_Body">Fisher Body</a> coachwork, and they only offered 2 styles, one was a 2-passenger 2-door Coupe, and the other one a 5-passenger Coach which was US$825. In December 28, 1925 begun the production at the Oakland Factory in Michigan, and was introduced on January 3, 1926. Henry Middlebook Crane designed a straight-6 split-flathead engine for the vehicle, that gave it 40 hp, but the top speed is unknown. When the production ended in 1932, 76,742 of these automobiles were made in total and later came the Second Generation which lasted from 1935 to 1940.

                        The Volvo ÖV 4 remains as the first car built by Volvo in 1926. The chassis and main parts were designed by Jan G.Smith who had worked several years in the American automobile industry, he was later a designer. The 4-cylinder side-valve engine was developed by Gustav Larson, which cave the vehicle a nice 28 hp, and it's mass of 1,170 kilograms could attract the machine to 90 km/h. Later in the summer of 1927, they made a new version, it was called the PV 4 and had a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weymann_Fabric_Bodies">Weymann body</a>. In 1928 the PV 4 was little bit improved, it now had a longer bonnet and thinner pillars which made the car design more balanced. Overall they produced 302 ÖV 4's and 694 PV 4's, so if you aren't good at mathematics, then don't worry, 996 produced in total and the making ended in 1929.

The car chassis was copied from one of the Chrysler vehicles at the time. It was the first mass-produced German car that was able to compete efficiently with other Chrysler cars in the 1920s. Later the Adler Standard 6 also became liked with the German upper middle class and taxi runners. The Adler Standard 6N 10/45 was the first version, which was equipped with a 6-cylinder side-valve engine with a 3-speed gearbox, gave it 44 hp and could reach 125 km/h. It is mentioned that 6,533 Adler Standard 6Ns were produced by the end of 1930. On the later periods came 3 more versions - The 6A 12/50, 6S 12/50 and 3U. They were just faster and got more horsepower. The production ended in March 1934 with 21,249 cars made in total.

                        Of course I'm putting this car on the list because first of all, the car weights about 3,175 kilograms and is 6.4 meters in length, now that feels like you are going in zombie apocalypse. It was built in 1927 by the manufacturer Bugatti, and production ended in 1933. This 12.76-litre straight-8 engine gave it around 275 - 300 hp and could attract the tank to 200 km/h. It had 3 valves per cylinder, and was driven by a single overhead camshaft that was positioned centrally. Ettore Bugatti planned to produce 25 of these cars, but turned out to be only 7. The first customer appeared in 1932, who bought one of the cars for $30,000. At least one car was destroyed in an accident in 1931, but 6 of them still remain today, where all of them have a different body and some of them are rebodied multiple times. Its also one of the largest cars in the world yet.

                        Under the direction of general manager William S. Knudsen, Chevrolet overtook Ford's selling in the market globally. Multiple versions of the Series AA were available, including 2-door coupe, 2-door roadster, 4-door sedan, 4-door tourer, commercial and regular trucks. The 2.8L inline-4 engine gave these cars 35 hp and could attract them to 90 km/h, well at least the tourer, but the trucks might have been slower due to the weight. The most basic version which was the 2-door coupe, cost $625, and overall Chevrolet was so successful that the company sold 1,001,820 Series AA cars, where the production had ended in the same year when it was started.

The car was equipped with a 6-cylinder, 6.7 L engine that was called "M06", which gave it a bright 180 hp and included a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercharger">supercharger</a>. The Model SS was the super sport version that was produced in the middle of 1928. This version's 7.1-litre engine produced 200 hp and could achieve a top speed of 190 km/h. In later 1928 came the Model SSK which stands for Super Sport Kurz. The turning ability was improved and the top speed was now even a bigger number, it was 192 km/h. In 1931 came the last S-Series model that was no joke. It was the Model SSKL meaning Super Sport Kurz Leicht which had the most high performance and was overall a pure racing car. The weight was reduced by 125 kg which made this vehicle weight 1,350 kg. This beast got 300 hp and could reach 235 km/h. There was a seperate version for <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_von_Brauchitsch">Manfred von Brauchitsch</a>, which was covered in an aerodynamic skin of aluminium sheets, and that made Brauchitsch's SSKL streamliner go 251 km/h, where it eventually won at the Avus race in May 1932. Later the car was named "Silver Arrow".

                        Its a small car produced by the Triumph Motor Company from 1927 to 1934. The development and design making began in 1925 by Arthur Sykes along with the help of Stanley Edge who was the draughtsman for the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_7">Austin 7</a>. It was finally introduced in September 1927 and was little bit bigger than the Austin 7. The car had an 4-cylinder side-valve, 0.7-litre engine that could drag this machine to 80 km/h. The cheapeast model was a 2-door, 4-seat tourer which cost £113, and the other models were de-luxe tourer with 2-coloured body, a 2-door saloon, 2-seater with dickey seat, a fabric-bodied saloon and a coachbuilt saloon. It depended on style, the Gordon England saloon was £190. Later came the faster versions, where one of them was launched in 1929 and was called the Specials Sports that cost £250, but also could reach 130 km/h with it's small supercharger. The production ended in 1934 with 17,000 Triumph Supers made.

                        The Duesenberg Model J was introduced in 1928 by the American automobile maker Duesenberg. The Model J's engine was based on succesful racing engines, the motors were designed by Duesenberg, but manufactured by Lycoming. It gave the machine a large number of 265 hp because of the dual overhead camshafts along with 4 valves per cylinder, and could reach 146 km/h. It was the fastest and most expesnive American automobile on the market, that cost US$8,500 which is equal to $182,315 in 2022. In May 1932, Fred Duesenberg launched the Supercharged version, the SJ. Now this machine along with supercharger that was beside the engine, contained 320 hp, where it could attract the vehicle to 217 - 225 km/h. Overall the company has produced more of these cars that were meant to compete with the most powerful and luxurious cars in the world.

                        The Maybach Zeppelin was produced by the car company Maybach in 1929 to 1939. It was another machine that weighted 3 tons and required vehicle license for cars over 2½ tons. The car is known because of the second luxury V12 vehicle production in Europe. The first model development began in 1928, and the name was "Maybach 12", but several months later the car made it to production and was now called "DS7". It was originally available from 1929 to 1930. It's 7,0 L V12 engine produced 150 hp at 2,800 rpm and could go 150 km/h. In 1930 came the new model, which was the DS8, that was more powerful than DS7. It was equipped with a 8.0 L V12 engine, that made 200 hp. It depended on the coachwork, how much weight was put onto this thing, but normally could reach 171 km/h. They have made a DS8 Roadster, where one of them sold for €1.3 million at auction in August 2012, and about 100 of these were ever built. Maybach have built a total of 1,800 cars between the years 1921 - 1940.

He is also known as Tim Birkin who turned to motosport in 1921, competing in several races at Brooklands. In later periods he had to retire from the tracks due to business and family, but was back on track in 1927, where he competed in a 6-hour race. In 1928, he didn't care about the family and entered the Le Mans race again where he eventually retired the race after 20 laps and finished fifth because of a jammed wheel. Later in 1929 he finally won the Le Mans 24-hour race where he used the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_Speed_Six">Speed Six</a> as co-driver to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolf_Barnato">Woolf Barnato</a>. Before Birkin won the race, he had a plan to fit a supercharger to the 4½ litre Bentley, where Bentley Motors rejected creating the supercharged model, so Birkin decided to develop it himself. The Bentley Blower No.1 has competed in the 800 km endurance race at Brooklands in 1929 as well, where it literally caught up in fire because of a cracked exhaust. It weighted 1,625 kg and was overall a fast car that could reach 222 km/h.

Even if these cars producing volume was much lower than the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DKW_F1">DKW F1</a>, they were still succesful cars, where 24,000 of them were made by the end of 1940. First came the DKW 4=8 Typ P25 in 1929, this vehicle with it's front mounted 4-cylinder V4 engine gave it 24 hp, but the top speed is unknown. The transmission was a 3-speed one and was one of the small cars that weighted 530 kg. Later came 6 more models, including the V 800, V 1000, Sonderklasse Typ 432, Sonderklasse 1001 and DKW Schwebeklasse, where these versions were little bit more powerful. The car had one problem tho, the engine kept overheating, even in cold weather, but still was a working machine that cost around 3,000 German Marks.

                        Renault made a vehicle series where it included whole different cars like the Monastella, Nervastella, Reinastella and Vivastella, which were produced from 1929 to 1939. The first car was the Renault Monastella Type RY1, which was a luxury car that included 4 different body styles - 4-door Sedan, 4-door Torpedo, 2-door Convertible, 2-door Coupe. It was meant to be a more luxurious version of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Monasix">Monasix</a>. It was first shown at the October 1928 motor show with it's radiator initially positioned behind the engine. At the end of 1928, Renault moved the radiator ahead of the engine, and now had a more standard looking. Originally this car had 26 hp, but the later versions RY2, RY3 and RY4 had 33 hp, where the cars had a 6-cylinder engine that dragged them to 90 km/h. Transmission was 3-speed, and the cars weighted about 1,350 kg. The Monastella series ended in 1932 with an unknown amount of these made. A little later came the 3 other cars which I mentioned before. The other cars had a completely different style and more powerful overall.

Also known as the last vehicle before Bentley's financial collapse, where it eventually forced sale to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Limited">Rolls-Royce Limited</a>.

The suspension was <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_spring">long semi-elliptic leaf springs</a>, and they were controlled by double acting shock absorbers. The engine produced over 200 hp and could attract the cars to 169 - 201 km/h. The chassis cost £1,850 and only 100 Bentley 8 Litres were made in total, where 78 of them have survived according to summer 2011. Today these machines saloon or limousine bodies are often replaced with replica tourer bodies.

                        The Cadillac V-16 was produced between 1930 to 1940 by the automobile manufacturer Cadillac. The development of the car began in 1926 and was successful because the company kept it in secret. Finally it was launched in January 1930, with a 7.4 L <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_V16_engine">V-16</a> engine that gifted the car with 185 hp and drived it 145 - 160 km/h. Over 1,000 units were built by April, and later by June 2,000 of these 1930 vehicles were made, which cost somewhere US$9,000. In 1933 the body was redesigned, and in 1934 the body was re-made again where the models were eventually named as the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z10282/cadillac-model-452d-v16.aspx">452D</a> and 452E in 1935. It wasn't a big improvement but still had a all-steel roof with the Fisher Turret Top. In 1937 the cars got a bigger body which made them weight 3,000 kg, and were mentioned that these were the largest standard production cars ever produced in the United States. These cars were large that weighted 2,400 - 3,000 kg, and about 3,700 Cadillac V-16s was produced in total.
